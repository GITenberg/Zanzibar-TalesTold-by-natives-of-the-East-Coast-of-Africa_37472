<h2 class="main">To My Readers.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Thirty years ago Central Africa was what people who
are fond of airing their learning would call a <i>terra incognita</i>.
To-day its general characteristics are pretty well known. Then, as now,
the little island of Zanzibar, situated just south of the equator, on
the east coast, was the starting place of all expeditions into the
interior, and Unguja (pronounced Oon-goo&prime;jah), the big town of
that island, the place where the preparations for plunging into the
unknown were made.</p>
<p>At that period these expeditions consisted, almost without
exception, of caravans loaded with beads and cotton cloth, which were
exchanged among the inland tribes for elephants&rsquo; tusks and
slaves&mdash;<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>for Unguja boasted the only, and the last, open
slave-market in the world then.</p>
<p>The few exceptions were a would-be discoverer now and then, or a
party of rich white men going to hunt &ldquo;big game;&rdquo; that is,
travelling hundreds&mdash;aye, thousands&mdash;of miles, and enduring
many hardships, for the momentary pleasure of holding a gun in such a
position that when they pulled the trigger the bullet hit such a
prominent mark as an elephant or a lion, which was living in its
natural surroundings and interfering with no one.</p>
<p>Between you and me, I don&rsquo;t mind remarking that many of their
expeditions ended, on their return to Unguja, in the purchase of a few
elephants&rsquo; tusks and wild animal skins in the bazaars of that
thriving city, after the method pursued by unsuccessful anglers in
civilized countries.</p>
<p>But even the most successful of these hunters, by reason of having
followed the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span>few beaten paths known to their guides, never came
within miles of such wonderful animals as those described by the
tribesmen from the very center of the dark continent. If you have read
any accounts of adventure in Africa, you will know that travelers never
mention animals of any kind that are gifted with the faculty of speech,
or gazelles that are overseers for native princes, or hares that eat
flesh. No, indeed; only the native-born know of these; and, judging by
the immense and rapid strides civilization is making in those parts, it
will not be long before such wonderful specimens of zo&ouml;logy will
be as extinct as the ichthyosaurus, dinornis, and other poor creatures
who never dreamed of the awful names that would be applied to them when
they were too long dead to show their resentment.</p>
<p>As to the truth of these tales, I can only say that they were told
to me, in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>Zanzibar, by negroes whose ancestors told them to
them, who had received them from <i>their</i> ancestors, and so back;
so that the praise for their accuracy, or the blame for their falsity,
lies with the first ancestor who set them going.</p>
<p>You may think uncivilized negroes are pretty ignorant people, but
the white man who is supposed to have first told the story of
&ldquo;The House that Jack Built&rdquo; was a mighty poor genius
compared with the unknown originator of &ldquo;Goso, the
Teacher,&rdquo; who found even inanimate things that were endowed with
speech, which the pupils readily understood and were not astonished to
hear; while &ldquo;Puss in Boots&rdquo; was not one-half so clever as
the gazelle that ran things for Haamdaanee. It would be a severe task
to rattle off &ldquo;Goso&rdquo; as you do &ldquo;The House that Jack
Built.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t stumble over the names in these <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span>tales; they
are very easy. Every one is pronounced exactly as it is spelled, and
the accent is always on the last syllable but one; as, Poon&prime;dah,
the donkey; Haam-daa&prime;nee, etc.</p>
<p>Finally, if the perusal of these tales interests you as much as
their narration and translation interested me, everything will be
satisfactory.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time Kee&prime;ma, the monkey, and
Pa&prime;pa, the shark, became great friends.</p>
<p>The monkey lived in an immense mkooyoo tree which grew by the margin
of the sea&mdash;half of its branches being over the water and half
over the land.</p>
<p>Every morning, when the monkey was breakfasting on the kooyoo nuts,
the shark would put in an appearance under the tree and call out,
&ldquo;Throw me some food, my friend;&rdquo; with which request the
monkey complied most willingly. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18"
href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span></p>
<p>This continued for many months, until one day Papa said,
&ldquo;Keema, you have done me many kindnesses: I would like you to go
with me to my home, that I may repay you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I go?&rdquo; said the monkey; &ldquo;we land beasts
can not go about in the water.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figure xd20e474width" id="p018"><img src="images/p018.jpg"
alt="&ldquo;Throw me some food, my friend.&rdquo;" width="439" height=
"450">
<p class="figureHead">&ldquo;Throw me some food, my friend.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble yourself about that,&rdquo; replied the
shark; &ldquo;I will carry you. Not a drop of water shall get to
you.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right, then,&rdquo; said Mr. Keema;
&ldquo;let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they had gone about half-way the shark stopped, and said:
&ldquo;You are my friend. I will tell you the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what is there to tell?&rdquo; asked the monkey, with
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, the fact is that our sultan is very sick, and
we have been told that the only medicine that will do him any good is a
monkey&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; exclaimed Keema, &ldquo;you were very foolish
not to tell me that before we started!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; asked Papa.</p>
<p>But the monkey was busy thinking up some means of saving himself,
and made no reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said the shark, anxiously; &ldquo;why
don&rsquo;t you speak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve nothing to say now. It&rsquo;s too late. But
if you had told me this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href=
"#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>before we started, I might have
brought my heart with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? haven&rsquo;t you your heart here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; ejaculated Keema; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know
about us? When we go out we leave our hearts in the trees, and go about
with only our bodies. But I see you don&rsquo;t believe me. You think
I&rsquo;m scared. Come on; let&rsquo;s go to your home, where you can
kill me and search for my heart in vain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shark did believe him, though, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, no;
let&rsquo;s go back and get your heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, no,&rdquo; protested Keema; &ldquo;let us go on to
your home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the shark insisted that they should go back, get the heart, and
start afresh.</p>
<p>At last, with great apparent reluctance, the monkey consented,
grumbling sulkily at the unnecessary trouble he was being put to.</p>
<p>When they got back to the tree, he <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>climbed up in a great
hurry, calling out, &ldquo;Wait there, Papa, my friend, while I get my
heart, and we&rsquo;ll start off properly next time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had got well up among the branches, he sat down and kept
quite still.</p>
<p>After waiting what he considered a reasonable length of time, the
shark called, &ldquo;Come along, Keema!&rdquo; But Keema just kept
still and said nothing.</p>
<p>In a little while he called again: &ldquo;Oh, Keema! let&rsquo;s be
going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this the monkey poked his head out from among the upper branches
and asked, in great surprise, &ldquo;Going? Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To my home, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you mad?&rdquo; queried Keema.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mad? Why, what do you mean?&rdquo; cried Papa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; said the monkey.
&ldquo;Do you take me for a washerman&rsquo;s donkey?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=
"pb22">22</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What peculiarity is there about a washerman&rsquo;s
donkey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a creature that has neither heart nor ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shark, his curiosity overcoming his haste, thereupon begged to
be told the story of the washerman&rsquo;s donkey, which the monkey
related as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A washerman owned a donkey, of which he was very fond. One
day, however, it ran away, and took up its abode in the forest, where
it led a lazy life, and consequently grew very fat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At length Soongoo&prime;ra, the hare, by chance passed that
way, and saw Poon&prime;da, the donkey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, the hare is the most cunning of all beasts&mdash;if you
look at his mouth you will see that he is always talking to himself
about everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So when Soongoora saw Poonda he said to himself, &lsquo;My,
this donkey is fat!&rsquo; Then he went and told Sim&prime;ba, the
lion. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span></p>
<div class="figure xd20e553width" id="p023"><img src="images/p023.gif"
alt=
"&ldquo;Miss Poonda, I am sent to ask your hand in marriage.&rdquo;"
width="397" height="527">
<p class="figureHead">&ldquo;Miss Poonda, I am sent to ask your hand in
marriage.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;As Simba was just recovering from a severe illness, he was
still so weak that he could not go hunting. He was consequently pretty
hungry. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Said Mr. Soongoora, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll bring enough meat
to-morrow for both of us to have a great feast, but you&rsquo;ll have
to do the killing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right, good friend,&rsquo; exclaimed Simba,
joyfully; &lsquo;you&rsquo;re very kind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the hare scampered off to the forest, found the donkey,
and said to her, in his most courtly manner, &lsquo;Miss Poonda, I am
sent to ask your hand in marriage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;By whom?&rsquo; simpered the donkey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;By Simba, the lion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The donkey was greatly elated at this, and exclaimed:
&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s go at once. This is a first-class offer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They soon arrived at the lion&rsquo;s home, were cordially
invited in, and sat down. Soongoora gave Simba a signal with his
eyebrow, to the effect that this was the promised feast, and that he
would wait outside. Then he said to Poonda: &lsquo;I must leave you for
a while to attend to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25"
name="pb25">25</a>]</span>some private business. You stay here and
converse with your husband that is to be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as Soongoora got outside, the lion sprang at Poonda,
and they had a great fight. Simba was kicked very hard, and he struck
with his claws as well as his weak health would permit him. At last the
donkey threw the lion down, and ran away to her home in the forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shortly after, the hare came back, and called, &lsquo;Haya!
Simba! have you got it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have not got it,&rsquo; growled the lion; &lsquo;she
kicked me and ran away; but I warrant you I made her feel pretty sore,
though I&rsquo;m not strong.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, well,&rsquo; remarked Soongoora;
&lsquo;don&rsquo;t put yourself out of the way about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Soongoora waited many days, until the lion and the
donkey were both well and strong, when he said: &lsquo;What do
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>you think now, Simba? Shall I bring you your
meat?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; growled the lion, fiercely; &lsquo;bring it
to me. I&rsquo;ll tear it in two pieces!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the hare went off to the forest, where the donkey welcomed
him and asked the news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You are invited to call again and see your
lover,&rsquo; said Soongoora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, dear!&rsquo; cried Poonda; &lsquo;that day you
took me to him he scratched me awfully. I&rsquo;m afraid to go near him
now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, pshaw!&rsquo; said Soongoora; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s
nothing. That&rsquo;s only Simba&rsquo;s way of caressing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, well,&rsquo; said the donkey, &lsquo;let&rsquo;s
go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So off they started again; but as soon as the lion caught
sight of Poonda he sprang upon her and tore her in two pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the hare came up, Simba said to him: &lsquo;Take this
meat and roast it. As for myself, all I want is the heart and
ears.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thanks,&rsquo; said Soongoora. Then he went away and
roasted the meat in a place where the lion could not see him, and he
took the heart and ears and hid them. Then he ate all the meat he
needed, and put the rest away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presently the lion came to him and said, &lsquo;Bring me the
heart and ears.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where are they?&rsquo; said the hare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What does this mean?&rsquo; growled Simba.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, didn&rsquo;t you know this was a
washerman&rsquo;s donkey?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, what&rsquo;s that to do with there being no
heart or ears?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake, Simba, aren&rsquo;t you old
enough to know that if this beast had possessed a heart and ears it
wouldn&rsquo;t have come back the second time?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course the lion had to admit that what Soongoora, the
hare, said was true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Keema to the shark, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>&ldquo;you want to make a washerman&rsquo;s donkey
of me. Get out of there, and go home by yourself. You are not going to
get me again, and our friendship is ended. Good-bye, Papa.&rdquo;

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One day Soongoo&prime;ra, the hare, roaming through
the forest in search of food, glanced up through the boughs of a very
large calabash tree, and saw that a great hole in the upper part of the
trunk was inhabited by bees; thereupon he returned to town in search of
some one to go with him and help to get the honey.</p>
<p>As he was passing the house of Boo&prime;koo, the big rat, that
worthy gentleman invited him in. So he went in, sat down, and remarked:
&ldquo;My father has died, and has left me a hive of honey. I would
like you to come and help me to eat it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course Bookoo jumped at the offer, and he and the hare started
off immediately. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span></p>
<p>When they arrived at the great calabash tree, Soongoora pointed out
the bees&rsquo; nest and said, &ldquo;Go on; climb up.&rdquo; So,
taking some straw with them, they climbed up to the nest, lit the
straw, smoked out the bees, put out the fire, and set to work eating
the honey.</p>
<p>In the midst of the feast, who should appear at the foot of the tree
but Sim&prime;ba, the lion? Looking up, and seeing them eating, he
asked, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Soongoora whispered to Bookoo, &ldquo;Hold your tongue; that
old fellow is crazy.&rdquo; But in a very little while Simba roared out
angrily: &ldquo;Who are you, I say? Speak, I tell you!&rdquo; This made
Bookoo so scared that he blurted out, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only
us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon this the hare said to him: &ldquo;You just wrap me up in this
straw, call to the lion to keep out of the way, and then throw me down.
Then you&rsquo;ll see what will happen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figure xd20e651width" id="p033"><img src="images/p033.gif"
alt="Bookoo and the hare started off immediately." width="405" height=

<p class="figureHead">Bookoo and the hare started off immediately.</p>

<p>So Bookoo, the big rat, wrapped Soongoora, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>the
hare, in the straw, and then called to Simba, the lion, &ldquo;Stand
back; I&rsquo;m going to throw this straw down, and then I&rsquo;ll
come down myself.&rdquo; When Simba stepped back out of the way, Bookoo
threw down the straw, and as it lay on the ground Soongoora crept out
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span>and ran away while the lion was looking up.</p>
<div class="figure xd20e663width" id="p035"><img src="images/p035.jpg"

width="441" height="538">
<p class="figureHead">Soongoora crept out and ran away while the lion

</div>
<p>After waiting a minute or two, Simba roared out, &ldquo;Well, come
down, I say!&rdquo; and, there being no help for it, the big rat came
down.</p>
<p>As soon as he was within reach, the lion caught hold of him, and
asked, &ldquo;Who was up there with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Bookoo, &ldquo;Soongoora, the hare.
Didn&rsquo;t you see him when I threw him down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I didn&rsquo;t see him,&rdquo; replied the lion, in
an incredulous tone, and, without wasting further time, he ate the big
rat, and then searched around for the hare, but could not find him.</p>
<p>Three days later, Soongoora called on his acquaintance,
Ko&prime;bay, the tortoise, and said to him, &ldquo;Let us go and eat
some honey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose honey?&rdquo; inquired Kobay, cautiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Soongoora replied. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right; I&rsquo;m with you,&rdquo; said the tortoise,
eagerly; and away they went.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the great calabash tree they climbed up with
their straw, smoked out the bees, sat down, and began to eat.</p>
<p>Just then Mr. Simba, who owned the honey, came out again, and,
looking up, inquired, &ldquo;Who are you, up there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soongoora whispered to Kobay, &ldquo;Keep quiet;&rdquo; but when the
lion repeated his question angrily, Kobay became suspicious, and said:
&ldquo;I <i>will</i> speak. You told me this honey was yours; am I
right in suspecting that it belongs to Simba?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, when the lion asked again, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he
answered, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only us.&rdquo; The lion said, &ldquo;Come
down, then;&rdquo; and the tortoise answered, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, Simba had been keeping an eye open for Soongoora since the day
he caught Bookoo, the big rat, and, suspecting that he was up there
with Kobay, he said to himself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got him this time,
sure.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span></p>
<p>Seeing that they were caught again, Soongoora said to the tortoise:
&ldquo;Wrap me up in the straw, tell Simba to stand out of the way, and
then throw me down. I&rsquo;ll wait for you below. He can&rsquo;t hurt
you, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Kobay; but while he was wrapping the
hare up he said to himself: &ldquo;This fellow wants to run away, and
leave me to bear the lion&rsquo;s anger. He shall get caught
first.&rdquo; Therefore, when he had bundled him up, he called out,
&ldquo;Soongoora is coming!&rdquo; and threw him down.</p>
<p>So Simba caught the hare, and, holding him with his paw, said,
&ldquo;Now, what shall I do with you?&rdquo; The hare replied,
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s of no use for you to try to eat me; I&rsquo;m awfully
tough.&rdquo; &ldquo;What would be the best thing to do with you,
then?&rdquo; asked Simba.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Soongoora, &ldquo;you should take me by
the tail, whirl me around, and knock me against the ground. Then you
may be able to eat me.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href=

<p class="figureHead">The lion continued rubbing on a piece of
rock.</p>
</div>
<p>So the lion, being deceived, took him by the tail and whirled him
around, but just as he was going to knock him on the ground he slipped
out of his grasp <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span>and ran away, and Simba had the mortification of
losing him again.</p>
<p>Angry and disappointed, he turned to the tree and called to Kobay,
&ldquo;You come down, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the tortoise reached the ground, the lion said,
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re pretty hard; what can I do to make you
eatable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s easy,&rdquo; laughed Kobay; &ldquo;just put
me in the mud and rub my back with your paw until my shell comes
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately on hearing this, Simba carried Kobay to the water,
placed him in the mud, and began, as he supposed, to rub his back; but
the tortoise had slipped away, and the lion continued rubbing on a
piece of rock until his paws were raw. When he glanced down at them he
saw they were bleeding, and, realizing that he had again been
outwitted, he said, &ldquo;Well, the hare has done me to-day, but
I&rsquo;ll go hunting now until I find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Simba, the lion, set out immediately <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>in
search of Soongoora, the hare, and as he went along he inquired of
every one he met, &ldquo;Where is the house of Soongoora?&rdquo; But
each person he asked answered, &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo; For the
hare had said to his wife, &ldquo;Let us remove from this house.&rdquo;
Therefore the folks in that neighborhood had no knowledge of his
whereabouts. Simba, however, went along, continuing his inquiries,
until presently one answered, &ldquo;That is his house on the top of
the mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without loss of time the lion climbed the mountain, and soon arrived
at the place indicated, only to find that there was no one at home.
This, however, did not trouble him; on the contrary, saying to himself,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hide myself inside, and when Soongoora and his wife
come home I&rsquo;ll eat them both,&rdquo; he entered the house and lay
down, awaiting their arrival.</p>
<p>Pretty soon along came the hare with his wife, not thinking of any
danger; but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>he very soon discovered the marks of the
lion&rsquo;s paws on the steep path. Stopping at once, he said to Mrs.
Soongoora: &ldquo;You go back, my dear. Simba, the lion, has passed
this way, and I think he must be looking for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she replied, &ldquo;I will not go back; I will follow you, my
husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although greatly pleased at this proof of his wife&rsquo;s
affection, Soongoora said firmly: &ldquo;No, no; you have friends to go
to. Go back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he persuaded her, and she went back; but he kept on, following
the footmarks, and saw&mdash;as he had suspected&mdash;that they went
into his house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;Mr. Lion is inside, is
he?&rdquo; Then, cautiously going back a little way, he called out:
&ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye do, house? How d&rsquo;ye do?&rdquo; Waiting a
moment, he remarked loudly: &ldquo;Well, this is very strange! Every
day, as I pass this place, I say, &lsquo;How d&rsquo;ye do,
house?&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>and the house always answers, &lsquo;How
d&rsquo;ye do?&rsquo; There must be some one inside to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the lion heard this he called out, &ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Soongoora burst out laughing, and shouted: &ldquo;Oho, Mr.
Simba! <i>You</i>&rsquo;re inside, and I&rsquo;ll bet you want to eat
<i>me</i>; but first tell me where you ever heard of a house
talking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon this the lion, seeing how he had been fooled, replied angrily,
&ldquo;You wait until I get hold of you; that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I think <i>you</i>&rsquo;ll have to do the
waiting,&rdquo; cried the hare; and then he ran away, the lion
following.</p>
<p>But it was of no use. Soongoora completely tired out old Simba, who,
saying, &ldquo;That rascal has beaten me; I don&rsquo;t want to have
anything more to do with him,&rdquo; returned to his home under the
great calabash tree. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45"

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time Sim&prime;ba, the lion,
Fee&prime;see, the hyena, and Keetee&prime;tee, the rabbit, made up
their minds to go in for a little farming. So they went into the
country, made a garden, planted all kinds of seeds, and then came home
and rested quite a while.</p>
<p>Then, when the time came when their crops should be about ripe and
ready for harvesting, they began to say to each other,
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go over to the farm, and see how our crops are
coming along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So one morning, early, they started, and, as the garden was a long
way off, Keeteetee, the rabbit, made this proposition: &ldquo;While we
are going to the farm, let us <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href=
"#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>not stop on the road; and if any one
does stop, let him be eaten.&rdquo; His companions, not being so
cunning as he, and knowing they could outwalk him, readily consented to
this arrangement.</p>
<p>Well, off they went; but they had not gone very far when the rabbit
stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; said Feesee, the hyena; &ldquo;Keeteetee has
stopped. He must be eaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the bargain,&rdquo; agreed Simba, the lion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the rabbit, &ldquo;I happened to be
thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about?&rdquo; cried his partners, with great
curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking,&rdquo; said he, with a grave,
philosophical air, &ldquo;about those two stones, one big and one
little; the little one does not go up, nor does the big one go
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lion and the hyena, having stopped to look at the stones, could
only say, &ldquo;Why, really, it&rsquo;s singular; but it&rsquo;s just
as you <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span>say;&rdquo; and they all resumed their journey,
the rabbit being by this time well rested.</p>

<p class="figureHead">The lion, the hyena, and the rabbit go in for a

</div>
<p>When they had gone some distance the rabbit stopped again.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; said Feesee; &ldquo;Keeteetee has stopped again.
Now he <i>must</i> be eaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather think so,&rdquo; assented Simba.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the rabbit, &ldquo;I was thinking
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their curiosity once more aroused, his comrades begged him to tell
them his think.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I was thinking this: When people
like us put on new coats, where do the old ones go to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both Simba and Feesee, having stopped a moment to consider the
matter, exclaimed together, &ldquo;Well, I wonder!&rdquo; and the three
went on, the rabbit having again had a good rest.</p>
<p>After a little while the hyena, thinking it about time to show off a
little of <i>his</i> philosophy, suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; growled Simba, &ldquo;this won&rsquo;t do; I
guess we&rsquo;ll have to eat you, Feesee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said the hyena; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
thinking.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you thinking about?&rdquo; they inquired.</p>
<div class="figure xd20e835width" id="p051"><img src="images/p051.jpg"
alt="Said the hyena, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking.&rdquo;" width="410"
height="428">
<p class="figureHead">Said the hyena, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
thinking.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking about nothing at all,&rdquo; said he,
imagining himself very smart and witty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, pshaw!&rdquo; cried Keeteetee; &ldquo;we won&rsquo;t be
fooled that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he and Simba ate the hyena. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52"
href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span></p>
<p>When they had finished eating their friend, the lion and the rabbit
proceeded on their way, and presently came to a place where there was a
cave, and here the rabbit stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; ejaculated Simba; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so
hungry as I was this morning, but I guess I&rsquo;ll have to find room
for you, little Keeteetee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I believe not,&rdquo; replied Keeteetee; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
thinking again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the lion, &ldquo;what is it this
time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said the rabbit: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking about that cave. In olden
times our ancestors used to go in here, and go out there, and I think
I&rsquo;ll try and follow in their footsteps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he went in at one end and out at the other end several times.</p>
<p>Then he said to the lion, &ldquo;Simba, old fellow, let&rsquo;s see
<i>you</i> try to do that;&rdquo; and the lion went into the cave, but
he stuck <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>fast, and could neither go forward nor back
out.</p>
<p>In a moment Keeteetee was on Simba&rsquo;s back, and began eating
him.</p>
<p>After a little time the lion cried, &ldquo;Oh, brother, be
impartial; come and eat some of the front part of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the rabbit replied, &ldquo;Indeed, I can&rsquo;t come around in
front; I&rsquo;m ashamed to look you in the face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, having eaten all he was able to, he left the lion there, and
went and became sole owner of the farm and its crops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One day Koongoo&prime;roo, sultan of the crows, sent a
letter to Mway&prime;way, sultan of the kites, containing these few
words: &ldquo;I want you folks to be my soldiers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this brief message Mwayway at once wrote this short reply:
&ldquo;I should say not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon, thinking to scare Mwayway, the sultan of the crows sent
him word, &ldquo;If you refuse to obey me I&rsquo;ll make war upon
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which the sultan of the kites replied, &ldquo;That suits me; let
us fight, and if you beat us we will obey you, but if we are victors
you shall be our servants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they gathered their forces and engaged in a great battle, and in
a little <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span>while it became evident that the crows were being
badly beaten.</p>
<p>As it appeared certain that, if something were not done pretty
quickly, they would all be killed, one old crow, named Jeeoo&prime;see,
suddenly proposed that they should fly away.</p>
<p>Directly the suggestion was made it was acted upon, and the crows
left their homes and flew far away, where they set up another town. So,
when the kites entered the place, they found no one there, and they
took up their residence in Crowtown.</p>
<p>One day, when the crows had gathered in council, Koongooroo stood up
and said: &ldquo;My people, do as I command you, and all will be well.
Pluck out some of my feathers and throw me into the town of the kites;
then come back and stay here until you hear from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without argument or questioning the crows obeyed their
sultan&rsquo;s command. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href=
"#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span></p>
<div class="figure xd20e907width" id="p059"><img src="images/p059.jpg"
alt="" width="387" height="562"></div>
<p>Koongooroo had lain in the street but a short time, when some
passing kites saw him and inquired threateningly, &ldquo;What are you
doing here in our town?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60"
href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span></p>
<p>With many a moan he replied, &ldquo;My companions have beaten me and
turned me out of their town because I advised them to obey Mwayway,
sultan of the kites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they heard this they picked him up and took him before the
sultan, to whom they said, &ldquo;We found this fellow lying in the
street, and he attributes his involuntary presence in our town to so
singular a circumstance that we thought you should hear his
story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Koongooroo was then bidden to repeat his statement, which he did,
adding the remark that, much as he had suffered, he still held to his
opinion that Mwayway was his rightful sultan.</p>
<p>This, of course, made a very favorable impression, and the sultan
said, &ldquo;You have more sense than all the rest of your tribe put
together; I guess you can stay here and live with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Koongooroo, expressing much gratitude, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>settled
down, apparently, to spend the remainder of his life with the
kites.</p>
<p>One day his neighbors took him to church with them, and when they
returned home they asked him, &ldquo;Who have the best kind of
religion, the kites or the crows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which crafty old Koongooroo replied, with great enthusiasm,
&ldquo;Oh, the kites, by long odds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This answer tickled the kites like anything, and Koongooroo was
looked upon as a bird of remarkable discernment.</p>
<p>When almost another week had passed, the sultan of the crows slipped
away in the night, went to his own town, and called his people
together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is the great annual
religious festival of the kites, and they will all go to church in the
morning. Go, now, and get some wood and some fire, and wait near their
town until I call you; then come quickly and set fire to the
church.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then he hurried back to Mwayway&rsquo;s town.</p>
<p>The crows were very busy indeed all that night, and by dawn they had
an abundance of wood and fire at hand, and were lying in wait near the
town of their victorious enemies.</p>
<p>So in the morning every kite went to church. There was not one
person left at home except old Koongooroo.</p>
<p>When his neighbors called for him they found him lying down.
&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; they exclaimed with surprise, &ldquo;are you not
going to church to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I wish I could; but my stomach
aches so badly I can&rsquo;t move!&rdquo; And he groaned
dreadfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, poor fellow!&rdquo; said they; &ldquo;you will be better
in bed;&rdquo; and they left him to himself.</p>
<p>As soon as everybody was out of sight he flew swiftly to his
soldiers and cried, &ldquo;Come on; they&rsquo;re all in the
church.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then they all crept quickly but quietly to the church, and while
some piled wood about the door, others applied fire.</p>

alt="They found him lying down." width="442" height="472">
<p class="figureHead">They found him lying down.</p>
</div>
<p>The wood caught readily, and the fire was burning fiercely before
the kites were aware of their danger; but when the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>church
began to fill with smoke, and tongues of flame shot through the cracks,
they tried to escape through the windows. The greater part of them,
however, were suffocated, or, having their wings singed, could not fly
away, and so were burned to death, among them their sultan, Mwayway;
and Koongooroo and his crows got their old town back again.</p>
<p>From that day to this the kites fly away from the crows.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once there was a man named Go&prime;so, who taught
children to read, not in a schoolhouse, but under a calabash tree. One
evening, while Goso was sitting under the tree deep in the study of the
next day&rsquo;s lessons, Paa, the gazelle, climbed up the tree very
quietly to steal some fruit, and in so doing shook off a calabash,
which, in falling, struck the teacher on the head and killed him.</p>
<p>When his scholars came in the morning and found their teacher lying
dead, they were filled with grief; so, after giving him a decent
burial, they agreed among themselves to find the one who had killed
Goso, and put him to death. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href=
"#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span></p>
<p>After talking the matter over they came to the conclusion that the
south wind was the offender.</p>
<p>So they caught the south wind and beat it.</p>
<p>But the south wind cried: &ldquo;Here! I am Koo&prime;see, the south
wind. Why are you beating me? What have I done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they said: &ldquo;Yes, we know you are Koosee; it was you who
threw down the calabash that struck our teacher Goso. You should not
have done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Koosee said, &ldquo;If I were so powerful would I be stopped by
a mud wall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they went to the mud wall and beat it.</p>
<p>But the mud wall cried: &ldquo;Here! I am Keeyambaa&prime;za, the
mud wall. Why are you beating me? What have I done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they said: &ldquo;Yes, we know you are Keeyambaaza; it was you
who stopped Koosee, the south wind; and Koosee, the <span class=

wind, threw down the calabash that struck our teacher Goso. You should
not have done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Keeyambaaza said, &ldquo;If I were so powerful would I be bored
through by the rat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they went and caught the rat and beat it.</p>
<p>But the rat cried: &ldquo;Here! I am Paan&prime;ya, the rat. Why are
you beating me? What have I done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they said: &ldquo;Yes, we know you are Paanya; it was you who
bored through Keeyambaaza, the mud wall; which stopped Koosee, the
south wind; and Koosee, the south wind, threw down the calabash that
struck our teacher Goso. You should not have done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Paanya said, &ldquo;If I were so powerful would I be eaten by a
cat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they hunted for the cat, caught it, and beat it.</p>
<p>But the cat cried: &ldquo;Here! I am Paa&prime;ka, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>the cat.
Why do you beat me? What have I done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they said: &ldquo;Yes, we know you are Paaka; it is you that
eats Paanya, the rat; who bores through Keeyambaaza, the mud wall;
which stopped Koosee, the south wind; and Koosee, the south wind, threw
down the calabash that struck our teacher Goso. You should not have
done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Paaka said, &ldquo;If I were so powerful would I be tied by a
rope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they took the rope and beat it.</p>
<p>But the rope cried: &ldquo;Here! I am Kaam&prime;ba, the rope. Why
do you beat me? What have I done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they said: &ldquo;Yes, we know you are Kaamba; it is you that
ties Paaka, the cat; who eats Paanya, the rat; who bores through
Keeyambaaza, the mud wall; which stopped Koosee, the south wind; and
Koosee, the south wind, threw down the calabash that struck our teacher
Goso. You should not have done it.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>But Kaamba said, &ldquo;If I were so powerful would I be cut by a

<p>So they took the knife and beat it.</p>
<p>But the knife cried: &ldquo;Here! I am Kee&prime;soo, the knife. Why

<p>And they said: &ldquo;Yes, we know you are Keesoo; you cut Kaamba,

the knife; that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=

who eats Paanya, the rat; who bores through Keeyambaaza, the mud wall;
which stopped Koosee, the south wind; and Koosee, the south wind, threw
down the calabash that struck our teacher Goso. You should not have
done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Moto said, &ldquo;If I were so powerful would I be put out by
water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they went to the water and beat it.</p>
<p>But the water cried: &ldquo;Here! I am Maa&prime;jee, the water. Why
do you beat me? What have I done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they said: &ldquo;Yes, we know you are Maajee; you put out Moto,
the fire; that burns Keesoo, the knife; that cuts Kaamba, the rope;

<p>But Maajee said, &ldquo;If I were so powerful would I be drunk by
the ox?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they went to the ox and beat it.</p>
<p>But the ox cried: &ldquo;Here! I am Ng&rsquo;om&prime;bay, the ox.
Why do you beat me? What have I done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they said: &ldquo;Yes, we know you are Ng&rsquo;ombay; you drink
Maajee, the water; that puts out Moto, the fire; that burns Keesoo, the
knife; that cuts Kaamba, the rope; that ties Paaka, the cat; who eats
Paanya, the rat; who bores through Keeyambaaza, the mud wall; which

<p>But Ng&rsquo;ombay said, &ldquo;If I were so powerful would I be
tormented by the fly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they caught a fly and beat it.</p>
<p>But the fly cried: &ldquo;Here! I am Een&prime;zee, the fly. Why do
you beat me? What have I done?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb74" href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span></p>
<p>And they said: &ldquo;Yes, we know you are Eenzee; you torment

Moto, the fire; that burns Keesoo, the knife; that cuts Kaamba, the

our teacher Goso. You should not have done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Eenzee said, &ldquo;If I were so powerful would I be eaten by
the gazelle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they searched for the gazelle, and when they found it they beat
it.</p>
<p>But the gazelle said: &ldquo;Here! I am Paa, the gazelle. Why do you
beat me? What have I done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gazelle, through surprise at being found out and fear of the
consequences of his accidental killing of the teacher, while engaged in
stealing, was struck dumb.</p>
<p>Then the scholars said: &ldquo;Ah! he hasn&rsquo;t a word to say for
himself. This is the fellow who threw down the calabash that struck our
teacher Goso. We will kill him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they killed Paa, the gazelle, and avenged the death of their
teacher.</p>

<p class="first">Long, long ago there lived, in a village called
Keejee&prime;jee, a woman whose husband died, leaving her with a little
baby boy. She worked hard all day to get food for herself and child,
but they lived very poorly and were most of the time half-starved.</p>
<p>When the boy, whose name was &rsquo;Mvoo&prime; Laa&prime;na, began
to get big, he said to his mother, one day: &ldquo;Mother, we are
always hungry. What work did my father do to support us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mother replied: &ldquo;Your father was a hunter. He set traps,
and we ate what he caught in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; said &rsquo;Mvoo Laana; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not
work; that&rsquo;s fun. I, too, will set traps, and see if we
can&rsquo;t get enough to eat.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb82" href="#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span></p>
<p>The next day he went into the forest and cut branches from the
trees, and returned home in the evening.</p>
<p>The second day he spent making the branches into traps.</p>
<p>The third day he twisted cocoanut fiber into ropes.</p>
<p>The fourth day he set up as many traps as time would permit.</p>
<p>The fifth day he set up the remainder of the traps.</p>
<p>The sixth day he went to examine the traps, and they had caught so
much game, beside what they needed for themselves, that he took a great
quantity to the big town of Oongoo&prime;ja, where he sold it and
bought corn and other things, and the house was full of food; and, as
this good fortune continued, he and his mother lived very
comfortably.</p>
<p>But after a while, when he went to his traps he found nothing in
them day after day.</p>
<div class="figure xd20e1124width" id="p083"><img src="images/p083.jpg"
alt="&ldquo;Mother, we are always hungry.&rdquo;" width="426" height=

<p class="figureHead">&ldquo;Mother, we are always hungry.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span></p>
<p>One morning, however, he found that an ape had been caught in one of
the traps, and he was about to kill it, when it said: &ldquo;Son of
Adam, I am Neea&prime;nee, the ape; do not kill me. Take me out of this
trap and let me go. Save me from the rain, that I may come and save you
from the sun some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So &rsquo;Mvoo Laana took him out of the trap and let him go.</p>
<p>When Neeanee had climbed up in a tree, he sat on a branch and said
to the youth: &ldquo;For your kindness I will give you a piece of
advice: Believe me, men are all bad. Never do a good turn for a man; if
you do, he will do you harm at the first opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second day, &rsquo;Mvoo Laana found a snake in the same trap. He
started to the village to give the alarm, but the snake shouted:
&ldquo;Come back, son of Adam; don&rsquo;t call the people from the
village to come and kill me. I am Neeo&prime;ka, the snake. Let me out
of this trap, I pray <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86"
name="pb86">86</a>]</span>you. Save me from the rain to-day, that I may
be able to save you from the sun to-morrow, if you should be in need of
help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the youth let him go; and as he went he said, &ldquo;I will
return your kindness if I can, but do not trust any man; if you do him
a kindness he will do you an injury in return at the first
opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The third day, &rsquo;Mvoo Laana found a lion in the same trap that
had caught the ape and the snake, and he was afraid to go near it. But
the lion said: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t run away; I am Sim&prime;ba
Kong&prime;way, the very old lion. Let me out of this trap, and I will
not hurt you. Save me from the rain, that I may save you from the sun
if you should need help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So &rsquo;Mvoo Laana believed him and let him out of the trap, and
Simba Kongway, before going his way, said: &ldquo;Son of Adam, you have
been kind to me, and I will repay you with kindness if I can; but never
do a kindness to a man, or he will pay you back with unkindness.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span></p>
<p>The next day a man was caught in the same trap, and when the youth
released him, he repeatedly assured him that he would never forget the
service he had done him in restoring his liberty and saving his
life.</p>
<p>Well, it seemed that he had caught all the game that could be taken
in traps, and &rsquo;Mvoo Laana and his mother were hungry every day,
with nothing to satisfy them, as they had been before. At last he said
to his mother, one day: &ldquo;Mother, make me seven cakes of the
little meal we have left, and I will go hunting with my bow and
arrows.&rdquo; So she baked him the cakes, and he took them and his bow
and arrows and went into the forest.</p>
<p>The youth walked and walked, but could see no game, and finally he
found that he had lost his way, and had eaten all his cakes but
one.</p>
<p>And he went on and on, not knowing whether he was going away from
his home or toward it, until he came to the wildest <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>and most
desolate looking wood he had ever seen. He was so wretched and tired
that he felt he must lie down and die, when suddenly he heard some one
calling him, and looking up he saw Neeanee, the ape, who said,
&ldquo;Son of Adam, where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied &rsquo;Mvoo Laana, sadly;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said the ape; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry.
Just sit down here and rest yourself until I come back, and I will
repay with kindness the kindness you once showed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Neeanee went away off to some gardens and stole a whole lot of
ripe paw-paws and bananas, and brought them to &rsquo;Mvoo Laana, and
said: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s plenty of food for you. Is there anything
else you want? Would you like a drink?&rdquo; And before the youth
could answer he ran off with a calabash and brought it back full of
water. So the youth ate heartily, and drank all the water he needed,
and then <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=
"pb91">91</a>]</span>each said to the other, &ldquo;Good-bye, till we
meet again,&rdquo; and went their separate ways.</p>
<div class="figure xd20e1166width" id="p089"><img src="images/p089.jpg"
alt="&ldquo;Where are you going, son of Adam?&rdquo;" width="433"
height="655">
<p class="figureHead">&ldquo;Where are you going, son of
Adam?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>When &rsquo;Mvoo Laana had walked a great deal farther without
finding which way he should go, he met Simba Kongway, who asked,
&ldquo;Where are you going, son of Adam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the youth answered, as dolefully as before, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know; I&rsquo;m lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, cheer up,&rdquo; said the very old lion, &ldquo;and
rest yourself here a little. I want to repay with kindness to-day the
kindness you showed me on a former day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So &rsquo;Mvoo Laana sat down. Simba Kongway went away, but soon
returned with some game he had caught, and then he brought some fire,
and the young man cooked the game and ate it. When he had finished he
felt a great deal better, and they bade each other good-bye for the
present, and each went his way. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92"
href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span></p>
<p>After he had traveled another very long distance the youth came to a
farm, and was met by a very, very old woman, who said to him:
&ldquo;Stranger, my husband has been taken very sick, and I am looking
for some one to make him some medicine. Won&rsquo;t you make it?&rdquo;
But he answered: &ldquo;My good woman, I am not a doctor, I am a
hunter, and never used medicine in my life. I can not help
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he came to the road leading to the principal city he saw a
well, with a bucket standing near it, and he said to himself:
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I want. I&rsquo;ll take a drink of nice
well-water. Let me see if the water can be reached.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he peeped over the edge of the well, to see if the water was high
enough, what should he behold but a great big snake, which, directly it
saw him, said, &ldquo;Son of Adam, wait a moment.&rdquo; Then it came
out of the well and said: &ldquo;How? Don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=
"pb93">93</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly do not,&rdquo; said the youth, stepping back a
little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; said the snake; &ldquo;I could never
forget <i>you</i>. I am Neeoka, whom you released from the trap. You
know I said, &lsquo;Save me from the rain, and I will save you from the
sun.&rsquo; Now, you are a stranger in the town to which you are going;
therefore hand me your little bag, and I will place in it the things
that will be of use to you when you arrive there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figure xd20e1195width" id="p093"><img src="images/p093.jpg"
alt="Neeoka filled the bag with chains of gold and silver." width="438"
height="312">
<p class="figureHead">Neeoka filled the bag with chains of gold and
silver.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span></p>
<p>So &rsquo;Mvoo Laana gave Neeoka the little bag, and he filled it
with chains of gold and silver, and told him to use them freely for his
own benefit. Then they parted very cordially.</p>
<p>When the youth reached the city, the first man he met was he whom he
had released from the trap, who invited him to go home with him, which
he did, and the man&rsquo;s wife made him supper.</p>
<p>As soon as he could get away unobserved, the man went to the sultan
and said: &ldquo;There is a stranger come to my house with a bag full
of chains of silver and gold, which he says he got from a snake that
lives in a well. But although he pretends to be a man, I know that he
is a snake who has power to look like a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the sultan heard this he sent some soldiers who brought
&rsquo;Mvoo Laana and his little bag before him. When they opened the
little bag, the man who was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href=
"#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>released from the trap persuaded the
people that some evil would come out of it, and affect the children of
the sultan and the children of the <span class="corr" id="xd20e1210"
title="Source: vizier">vizir</span>.</p>
<p>Then the people became excited, and tied the hands of &rsquo;Mvoo
Laana behind him.</p>
<p>But the great snake had come out of the well and arrived at the town
just about this time, and he went and lay at the feet of the man who
had said all those bad things about &rsquo;Mvoo Laana, and when the
people saw this they said to that man: &ldquo;How is this? There is the
great snake that lives in the well, and he stays by you. Tell him to go
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Neeoka would not stir. So they untied the young man&rsquo;s
hands, and tried in every way to make amends for having suspected him
of being a wizard.</p>
<p>Then the sultan asked him, &ldquo;Why should this man invite you to
his home and then speak ill of you?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span></p>
<p>And &rsquo;Mvoo Laana related all that had happened to him, and how
the ape, the snake, and the lion had cautioned him about the results of
doing any kindness for a man.</p>
<p>And the sultan said: &ldquo;Although men are often ungrateful, they
are not always so; only the bad ones. As for this fellow, he deserves
to be put in a sack and drowned in the sea. He was treated kindly, and
returned evil for good.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97"

<p class="first">Once there was a very poor man, named
Haamdaa&prime;nee, who begged from door to door for his living,
sometimes taking things before they were offered him. After a while
people became suspicious of him, and stopped giving him anything, in
order to keep him away from their houses. So at last he was reduced to
the necessity of going every morning to the village dust heap, and
picking up and eating the few grains of the tiny little millet seed
that he might find there.</p>
<p>One day, as he was scratching and turning over the heap, he found a
dime, which he tied up in a corner of his ragged dress, and continued
to hunt for millet grains, but could not find one. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a dime now;
I&rsquo;m pretty well fixed. I&rsquo;ll go home and take a nap instead
of a meal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he went to his hut, took a drink of water, put some tobacco in
his mouth, and went to sleep.</p>
<p>The next morning, as he scratched in the dust heap, he saw a
countryman going along, carrying a basket made of twigs, and he called
to him: &ldquo;Hi, there, countryman! What have you in that
cage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The countryman, whose name was Moohaad&prime;eem, replied,
&ldquo;Gazelles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Haamdaanee called: &ldquo;Bring them here. Let me see
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now there were three well-to-do men standing near; and when they saw
the countryman coming to Haamdaanee they smiled, and said,
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re taking lots of trouble for nothing,
Moohaadeem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that, gentlemen?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;that poor fellow has nothing at
all. Not a cent.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href=
"#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; said the countryman;
&ldquo;he may have plenty, for all I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not he,&rdquo; said they.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see for yourself,&rdquo; continued one of
them, &ldquo;that he is on the dust heap? Every day he scratches there
like a hen, trying to get enough grains of millet to keep himself
alive. If he had any money, wouldn&rsquo;t he buy a square meal, for
once in his life? Do you think he would want to buy a gazelle? What
would he do with it? He can&rsquo;t find enough food for himself,
without looking for any for a gazelle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Moohaadeem said: &ldquo;Gentlemen, I have brought some goods
here to sell. I answer all who call me, and if any one says
&lsquo;Come,&rsquo; I go to him. I don&rsquo;t favor one and slight
another; therefore, as this man called me, I&rsquo;m going to
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the first man; &ldquo;you <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>don&rsquo;t believe us. Well, we know where he
lives, and all about him, and we know that he can&rsquo;t buy
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said the second man. &ldquo;Perhaps,
however, you will see that we were right, after you have a talk with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which the third man added, &ldquo;Clouds are a sign of rain, but
we have seen no signs of his being about to spend any money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Moohaadeem; &ldquo;many
better-looking people than he call me, and when I show them my gazelles
they say, &lsquo;Oh, yes, they&rsquo;re very beautiful, but awfully
dear; take them away.&rsquo; So I shall not be disappointed if this man
says the same thing. I shall go to him, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then one of the three men said, &ldquo;Let us go with this man, and
see what the beggar will buy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; said another; &ldquo;buy! You <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>talk
foolishly. He has not had a good meal in three years, to my knowledge;
and a man in his condition doesn&rsquo;t have money to buy gazelles.
However, let&rsquo;s go; and if he makes this poor countryman carry his
load over there just for the fun of looking at the gazelles, let each
of us give him a good hard whack with our walking-sticks, to teach him
how to behave toward honest merchants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, when they came near him, one of those three men said:
&ldquo;Well, here are the gazelles; now buy one. Here they are, you old
hypocrite; you&rsquo;ll feast your eyes on them, but you can&rsquo;t
buy them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Haamdaanee, paying no attention to the men, said to Moohaadeem,
&ldquo;How much for one of your gazelles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then another of those men broke in: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very
innocent, aren&rsquo;t you? You know, as well as I do, that gazelles
are sold every day at two for a quarter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still taking no notice of these outsiders, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>Haamdaanee continued, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to
buy one for a dime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One for a dime!&rdquo; laughed the men; &ldquo;of course
you&rsquo;d like to buy one for a dime. Perhaps you&rsquo;d also like
to have the dime to buy with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then one of them gave him a push on the cheek.</p>
<p>At this Haamdaanee turned and said: &ldquo;Why do you push me on the
cheek, when I&rsquo;ve done nothing to you? I do not know you. I call
this man, to transact some business with him, and you, who are
strangers, step in to spoil our trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then untied the knot in the corner of his ragged coat, produced
the dime, and, handing it to Moohaadeem, said, &ldquo;Please, good man,
let me have a gazelle for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this, the countryman took a small gazelle out of the cage and
handed it to him, saying, &ldquo;Here, master, take this one. I call it
Keejee&prime;paa.&rdquo; Then turning to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb105" href="#pb105" name="pb105">105</a>]</span>those three men, he
laughed, and said: &ldquo;Ehe! How&rsquo;s this? You, with your white
robes, and turbans, and swords, and daggers, and sandals on your
feet&mdash;you gentlemen of property, and no mistake&mdash;you told me
this man was too poor to buy anything; yet he has bought a gazelle for
a dime, while you fine fellows, I think, haven&rsquo;t enough money
among you to buy half a gazelle, if they were five cents
each.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Moohaadeem and the three men went their several ways.</p>
<p>As for Haamdaanee, he stayed at the dust heap until he found a few
grains of millet for himself and a few for Keejeepaa, the gazelle, and
then went to his hut, spread his sleeping mat, and he and the gazelle
slept together.</p>
<p>This going to the dust heap for a few grains of millet and then
going home to bed continued for about a week.</p>
<p>Then one night Haamdaanee was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106"
href="#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span>awakened by some one calling,
&ldquo;Master!&rdquo; Sitting up, he answered: &ldquo;Here I am. Who
calls?&rdquo; The gazelle answered, &ldquo;I do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon this, the beggar man became so scared that he did not know
whether he should faint or get up and run away.</p>
<p>Seeing him so overcome, Keejeepaa asked, &ldquo;Why, master,
what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, gracious!&rdquo; he gasped; &ldquo;what a wonder I
see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wonder?&rdquo; said the gazelle, looking all around;
&ldquo;why, what is this wonder, that makes you act as if you were all
broken up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s so wonderful, I can hardly believe I&rsquo;m
awake!&rdquo; said his master. &ldquo;Who in the world ever before knew
of a gazelle that could speak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; laughed Keejeepaa; &ldquo;is that all? There are
many more wonderful things than that. But now, listen, while I tell you
why I called you.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href=
"#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly; I&rsquo;ll listen to every word,&rdquo; said the
man. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help listening!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, it&rsquo;s just this way,&rdquo; said
Keejeepaa; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve allowed you to become my master, and I can
not run away from you; so I want you to make an agreement with me, and
I will make you a promise, and keep it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say on,&rdquo; said his master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; continued the gazelle, &ldquo;one doesn&rsquo;t
have to be acquainted with you long, in order to discover that you are
very poor. This scratching a few grains of millet from the dust heap
every day, and managing to subsist upon them, is all very well for
you&mdash;you&rsquo;re used to it, because it&rsquo;s a matter of
necessity with you; but if I keep it up much longer, you won&rsquo;t
have any gazelle&mdash;Keejeepaa will die of starvation. Therefore, I
want to go away every day and feed on my own kind of food; and I
promise you I will return every evening.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess I&rsquo;ll have to give my consent,&rdquo; said
the man, in no very cheerful tone.</p>
<p>As it was now dawn, Keejeepaa jumped up and ran out of the door,
Haamdaanee following him. The gazelle ran very fast, and his master
stood watching him until he disappeared. Then tears started in the
man&rsquo;s eyes, and, raising his hands, he cried, &ldquo;Oh, my
mother!&rdquo; Then he cried, &ldquo;Oh, my father!&rdquo; Then he
cried, &ldquo;Oh, my gazelle! It has run away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of his neighbors, who heard him carrying on in this manner,
took the opportunity to inform him that he was a fool, an idiot, and a
dissipated fellow.</p>
<p>Said one of them: &ldquo;You hung around that dust heap, goodness
knows how long, scratching like a hen, till fortune gave you a dime.
You hadn&rsquo;t sense enough to go and buy some decent food; you had
to buy a gazelle. Now you&rsquo;ve let the creature <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>run
away. What are you crying about? You brought all your trouble on
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this, of course, was very comforting to Haamdaanee, who slunk
off to the dust heap, got a few grains of millet, and came back to his
hut, which now seemed meaner and more desolate than ever.</p>
<p>At sunset, however, Keejeepaa came trotting in; and the beggar was
happy again, and said, &ldquo;Ah, my friend, you have returned to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said the gazelle; &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t I
promise you? You see, I feel that when you bought me you gave all the
money you had in the world, even though it was only a dime. Why, then,
should I grieve you? I couldn&rsquo;t do it. If I go and get myself
some food, I&rsquo;ll always come back evenings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the neighbors saw the gazelle come home every evening and run
off every morning, they were greatly surprised, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span>and
began to suspect that Haamdaanee was a wizard.</p>
<p>Well, this coming and going continued for five days, the gazelle
telling its master each night what fine places it had been to, and what
lots of food it had eaten.</p>
<p>On the sixth day it was feeding among some thorn bushes in a thick
wood, when, scratching away some bitter grass at the foot of a big
tree, it saw an immense diamond of intense brightness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; said Keejeepaa, in great astonishment;
&ldquo;here&rsquo;s property, and no mistake! This is worth a kingdom!
If I take it to my master he will be killed; for, being a poor man, if
they say to him, &lsquo;Where did you get it?&rsquo; and he answers,
&lsquo;I picked it up,&rsquo; they will not believe him; if he says,
&lsquo;It was given to me,&rsquo; they will not believe him either. It
will not do for me to get my master into difficulties. I know what
I&rsquo;ll do. I&rsquo;ll seek some powerful person; he will use it
properly.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111"
name="pb111">111</a>]</span></p>
<p>So Keejeepaa started off through the forest, holding the diamond in
his mouth, and ran, and ran, but saw no town that day; so he slept in
the forest, and arose at dawn and pursued his way. And the second day
passed like the first.</p>
<p>On the third day the gazelle had traveled from dawn until between
eight and nine o&rsquo;clock, when he began to see scattered houses,
getting larger in size, and knew he was approaching a town. In due time
he found himself in the main street of a large city, leading direct to
the sultan&rsquo;s palace, and began to run as fast as he could. People
passing along stopped to look at the strange sight of a gazelle running
swiftly along the main street with something wrapped in green leaves
between its teeth.</p>
<p>The sultan was sitting at the door of his palace, when Keejeepaa,
stopping a little way off, dropped the diamond from its mouth, and,
lying down beside it, panting, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112"
href="#pb112" name="pb112">112</a>]</span>called out: &ldquo;Ho, there!
Ho, there!&rdquo; which is a cry every one makes in that part of the
world when wishing to enter a house, remaining outside until the cry is
answered.</p>
<p>After the cry had been repeated several times, the sultan said to
his attendants, &ldquo;Who is doing all that calling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And one answered, &ldquo;Master, it&rsquo;s a gazelle that&rsquo;s
calling, &lsquo;Ho, there!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho-ho!&rdquo; said the sultan; &ldquo;Ho-ho! Invite the
gazelle to come near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then three attendants ran to Keejeepaa and said: &ldquo;Come, get
up. The sultan commands you to come near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the gazelle arose, picked up the diamond, and, approaching the
sultan, laid the jewel at his feet, saying, &ldquo;Master, good
afternoon!&rdquo; To which the sultan replied: &ldquo;May God make it
good! Come near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sultan ordered his attendants to bring a carpet and a large
cushion, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>desired the gazelle to rest upon them. When it
protested that it was comfortable as it was, he insisted, and Keejeepaa
had to allow himself to be made a very honored guest. Then they brought
milk and rice, and the sultan would hear nothing until the gazelle had
fed and rested.</p>
<p>At last, when everything had been disposed of, the sultan said,
&ldquo;Well, now, my friend, tell me what news you bring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Keejeepaa said: &ldquo;Master, I don&rsquo;t exactly know how
you will like the news I bring. The fact is, I&rsquo;m sent here to
insult you! I&rsquo;ve come to try and pick a quarrel with you! In
fact, I&rsquo;m here to propose a family alliance with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this the sultan exclaimed: &ldquo;Oh, come! for a gazelle, you
certainly know how to talk! Now, the fact of it is, I&rsquo;m looking
for some one to insult me. I&rsquo;m just aching to have some one pick
a quarrel with me. I&rsquo;m impatient for a family alliance. Go on
with your message.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href=
"#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then Keejeepaa said, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t bear any ill will
against me, who am only a messenger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the sultan said, &ldquo;None at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Keejeepaa, &ldquo;look at this pledge I
bring;&rdquo; dropping the diamond wrapped in leaves into the
sultan&rsquo;s lap.</p>
<p>When the sultan opened the leaves and saw the great, sparkling
jewel, he was overcome with astonishment. At last he said,
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have brought this pledge,&rdquo; said the gazelle,
&ldquo;from my master, Sultan Daaraa&prime;ee. He has heard that you
have a daughter, so he sent you this jewel, hoping you will forgive him
for not sending something more worthy of your acceptance than this
trifle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; said the sultan to himself; &ldquo;he calls
this a trifle!&rdquo; Then to the gazelle: &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all
right; that&rsquo;s all right. I&rsquo;m satisfied. The Sultan Daaraaee
has my consent to marry my daughter, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb115" href="#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>and I don&rsquo;t
want a single thing from him. Let him come empty-handed. If he has more
of these trifles, let him leave them at home. This is my message, and I
hope you will make it perfectly clear to your master.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figure xd20e1411width" id="p115"><img src="images/p115.jpg"

<p class="figureHead">Dropping the diamond wrapped in leaves into the

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=
"pb116">116</a>]</span></p>
<p>The gazelle assured him that he would explain everything
satisfactorily, adding: &ldquo;And now, master, I take my leave. I go
straight to our own town, and hope that in about eleven days we shall
return to be your guests.&rdquo; So, with mutual compliments, they
parted.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Haamdaanee was having an exceedingly tough time.
Keejeepaa having disappeared, he wandered about the town moaning,
&ldquo;Oh, my poor gazelle! my poor gazelle!&rdquo; while the neighbors
laughed and jeered at him, until, between them and his loss, he was
nearly out of his mind.</p>
<p>But one evening, when he had gone to bed, Keejeepaa walked in. Up he
jumped, and began to embrace the gazelle, and weep over it, and carry
on at a great rate.</p>
<p>When he thought there had been about enough of this kind of thing,
the gazelle said: &ldquo;Come, come; keep quiet, my master. I&rsquo;ve
brought you good news.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117"
href="#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>But the beggar man continued
to cry and fondle, and declare that he had thought his gazelle was
dead.</p>
<p>At last Keejeepaa said: &ldquo;Oh, well, master, you see I&rsquo;m
all right. You must brace up, and prepare to hear my news, and do as I
advise you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on; go on,&rdquo; replied his master; &ldquo;explain what
you will, I&rsquo;ll do whatever you require me to do. If you were to
say, &lsquo;Lie down on your back, that I may roll you over the side of
the hill,&rsquo; I would lie down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the gazelle, &ldquo;there is not much to
explain just now, but I&rsquo;ll tell you this: I&rsquo;ve seen many
kinds of food, food that is desirable and food that is objectionable,
but this food I&rsquo;m about to offer you is very sweet
indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Haamdaanee. &ldquo;Is it possible that in
this world there is anything that is positively good? There must be
good and bad in everything. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href=
"#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>Food that is both sweet and bitter
is good food, but if food were nothing but sweetness would it not be
injurious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; yawned the gazelle; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too
tired to talk philosophy. Let&rsquo;s go to sleep now, and when I call
you in the morning, all you have to do is to get up and follow
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So at dawn they set forth, the gazelle leading the way, and for five
days they journeyed through the forest.</p>
<p>On the fifth day they came to a stream, and Keejeepaa said to his
master, &ldquo;Lie down here.&rdquo; When he had done so, the gazelle
set to and beat him so soundly that he cried out: &ldquo;Oh, let up, I
beg of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the gazelle, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going away,
and when I return I expect to find you right here; so don&rsquo;t you
leave this spot on any account.&rdquo; Then he ran away, and about ten
o&rsquo;clock that morning he arrived at the house of the sultan.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span></p>
<p>Now, ever since the day Keejeepaa left the town, soldiers had been
placed along the road to watch for and announce the approach of Sultan
Daaraaee; so one of them, when he saw the gazelle in the distance,
rushed up and cried to the sultan, &ldquo;Sultan Daaraaee is coming!
I&rsquo;ve seen the gazelle running as fast as it can in this
direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sultan and his attendants immediately set out to meet his
guests; but when they had gone a little way beyond the town they met
the gazelle coming along alone, who, on reaching the sultan, said,
&ldquo;Good day, my master.&rdquo; The sultan replied in kind, and
asked the news, but Keejeepaa said: &ldquo;Ah, do not ask me. I can
scarcely walk, and my news is bad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how is that?&rdquo; asked the sultan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; sighed the gazelle; &ldquo;such misfortune
and misery! You see, Sultan Daaraaee and I started alone to come
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span>here, and we got along all right until we came
to the thick part of the forest yonder, when we were met by robbers,
who seized my master, bound him, beat him, and took everything he had,
even stripping off every stitch of his clothing. Oh, dear! oh,
dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said the sultan; &ldquo;we must attend to
this at once.&rdquo; So, hurrying back with his attendants to his
house, he called a groom, to whom he said, &ldquo;Saddle the best horse
in my stable, and put on him my finest harness.&rdquo; Then he directed
a woman servant to open the big inlaid chest and bring him a bag of
clothes. When she brought it he picked out a loin-cloth, and a long
white robe, and a black overjacket, and a shawl for the waist, and a
turban cloth, all of the very finest. Then he sent for a curved sword
with a gold hilt, and a curved dagger with gold filigree, and a pair of
elegant sandals, and a fine walking-cane. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb121" href="#pb121" name="pb121">121</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the sultan said to Keejeepaa, &ldquo;Take some of my soldiers,
and let them convey these things to Sultan Daaraaee, that he may dress
himself and come to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the gazelle answered: &ldquo;Ah, my master, can I take these
soldiers with me and put Sultan Daaraaee to shame? There he lies,
beaten and robbed, and I would not have any one see him. I can take
everything by myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; exclaimed the sultan, &ldquo;here is a horse, and
there are clothes and arms. I don&rsquo;t see how a little gazelle can
manage all those things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the gazelle had them fasten everything on the horse&rsquo;s
back, and tie the end of the bridle around his own neck, and then he
set off alone, amidst the wonder and admiration of the people of that
city, high and low.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the place where he had left the beggar-man, he
found him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>lying waiting for him, and overjoyed at his
return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have brought you the sweet food
I promised. Come, get up and bathe yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the hesitation of a person long unaccustomed to such a thing,
the man stepped into the stream and began to wet himself a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the gazelle, impatiently, &ldquo;a little
water like that won&rsquo;t do <i>you</i> much good; get out into the
deep pool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said the man, timidly; &ldquo;there is so
much water there; and where there is much water there are sure to be
horrible animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Animals! What kind of animals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, crocodiles, water lizards, snakes, and, at any rate,
frogs; and they bite people, and I&rsquo;m terribly afraid of all of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said Keejeepaa, &ldquo;do the best you can
in the stream; but rub <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href=
"#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span>yourself well with earth, and, for
goodness&rsquo; sake, scrub your teeth well with sand; they are awfully
dirty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the man obeyed, and soon made quite a change in his
appearance.</p>
<p>Then the gazelle said: &ldquo;Here, hurry up and put on these
things. The sun has gone down, and we ought to have started before
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the man dressed himself in the fine clothes the sultan had sent,
and then he mounted the horse, and they started; the gazelle trotting
on ahead.</p>
<p>When they had gone some distance, the gazelle stopped, and said,
&ldquo;See here: nobody who sees you now would suspect that you are the
man who scratched in the dust heap yesterday. Even if we were to go
back to our town the neighbors would not recognize you, if it were only
for the fact that your face is clean and your teeth are white. Your
appearance is all right, but I have a caution <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>to
give you. Over there, where we are going, I have procured for you the
sultan&rsquo;s daughter for a wife, with all the usual wedding gifts.
Now, you must keep quiet. Say nothing except, &lsquo;How d&rsquo;ye
do?&rsquo; and &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the news?&rsquo; Let me do the
talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;that suits me
exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what your name is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed? Well, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, my name is Haamdaanee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; laughed Keejeepaa; &ldquo;your name is
Sultan Daaraaee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, is it?&rdquo; said his master. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they started forward again, and in a little while they saw
soldiers running in every direction, and fourteen of these joined them
to escort them. Then they saw ahead of them the sultan, and the vizirs,
and the emirs, and the judges, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125"
href="#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span>the great men of the city,
coming to meet them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; said Keejeepaa, &ldquo;get off your horse
and salute your father-in-law. That&rsquo;s him in the middle, wearing
the sky-blue jacket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the man, jumping off his horse, which
was then led by a soldier.</p>
<p>So the two met, and the sultans shook hands, and kissed each other,
and walked up to the palace together.</p>
<p>Then they had a great feast, and made merry and talked until night,
at which time Sultan Daaraaee and the gazelle were put into an inner
room, with three soldiers at the door to guard and attend upon
them.</p>
<p>When the morning came, Keejeepaa went to the sultan and said:
&ldquo;Master, we wish to attend to the business which brought us here.
We want to marry your daughter, and the sooner the ceremony takes
place, the better it will please the Sultan Daaraaee.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said the sultan;
&ldquo;the bride is ready. Let some one call the teacher,
Mwaalee&prime;moo, and tell him to come at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Mwaaleemoo arrived, the sultan said, &ldquo;See here, we want
you to marry this gentleman to my daughter right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; said the teacher. So they
were married.</p>
<p>Early the next morning the gazelle said to his master: &ldquo;Now
I&rsquo;m off on a journey. I shall be gone about a week; but however
long I am gone, don&rsquo;t you leave the house till I return.
Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he went to the real sultan and said: &ldquo;Good master, Sultan
Daaraaee has ordered me to return to our town and put his house in
order; he commands me to be here again in a week; if I do not return by
that time, he will stay here until I come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sultan asked him if he would not <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb127" href="#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>like to have some
soldiers go with him; but the gazelle replied that he was quite
competent to take care of himself, as his previous journeys had proved,
and he preferred to go alone; so with mutual good wishes they
parted.</p>
<p>But Keejeepaa did not go in the direction of the old village. He
struck off by another road through the forest, and after a time came to
a very fine town, of large, handsome houses. As he went through the
principal street, right to the far end, he was greatly astonished to
observe that the town seemed to have no inhabitants, for he saw neither
man, woman, nor child in all the place.</p>
<p>At the end of the main street he came upon the largest and most
beautiful house he had ever seen, built of sapphire, and turquoise, and
costly marbles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my!&rdquo; said the gazelle; &ldquo;this house would just
suit my master. I&rsquo;ll have to pluck up my courage and see whether
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>this is deserted like the other houses in this
mysterious town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Keejeepaa knocked at the door, and called, &ldquo;Hullo,
there!&rdquo; several times; but no one answered. And he said to
himself: &ldquo;This is strange! If there were no one inside, the door
would be fastened on the outside. Perhaps they are in another part of
the house, or asleep. I&rsquo;ll call again, louder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he called again, very loud and long, &ldquo;Hul-lo, th-e-re!
Hul-lo!&rdquo; And directly an old woman inside answered, &ldquo;Who is
that calling so loudly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is I, your grandchild, good mistress,&rdquo; said
Keejeepaa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are my grandchild,&rdquo; replied the old woman,
&ldquo;go back to your home at once; don&rsquo;t come and die here, and
bring me to my death also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;open the door, mistress; I
have just a few words I wish to say to you.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear grandson,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;the only reason
why I do not open the door is because I fear to endanger both your life
and my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t worry about that; I guess your life and mine
are safe enough for a while. Open the door, anyhow, and hear the little
I have to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the old woman opened the door.</p>
<p>Then they exchanged salutations and compliments, after which she
asked the gazelle, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the news from your place,
grandson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, everything is going along pretty well,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s the news around here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; sighed the old creature; &ldquo;the news here is
very bad. If you&rsquo;re looking for a place to die in, you&rsquo;ve
struck it here. I&rsquo;ve not the slightest doubt you&rsquo;ll see all
you want of death this very day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; replied Keejeepaa, lightly; &ldquo;for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>a fly to die in honey is not bad for the fly,
and doesn&rsquo;t injure the honey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be all very well for you to be easy about it,&rdquo;
persisted the old person; &ldquo;but if people with swords and shields
did not escape, how can a little thing like you avoid danger? I must
again beg of you to go back to the place you came from. Your safety
seems of more interest to me than it is to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, I can&rsquo;t go back just now; and besides, I
want to find out more about this place. Who owns it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, grandson, in this house are enormous wealth, numbers of
people, hundreds of horses, and the owner is Neeo&prime;ka Mkoo&prime;,
the wonderfully big snake. He owns this whole town, also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho! Is that so?&rdquo; said Keejeepaa. &ldquo;Look here, old
lady; can&rsquo;t you put me on to some plan of getting near this big
snake, that I may kill him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo; cried the old woman, in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span>affright; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t talk like that.
You&rsquo;ve put my life in danger already, for I&rsquo;m sure Neeoka
Mkoo can hear what is said in this house, wherever he is. You see
I&rsquo;m a poor old woman, and I have been placed here, with those
pots and pans, to cook for him. Well, when the big snake is coming, the
wind begins to blow and the dust flies as it would do in a great storm.
Then, when he arrives in the courtyard, he eats until he is full, and
after that, goes inside there to drink water. When he has finished, he
goes away again. This occurs every other day, just when the sun is
overhead. I may add that Neeoka Mkoo has seven heads. Now, then, do you
think yourself a match for him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, mother,&rdquo; said the gazelle,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you worry about me. Has this big snake a
sword?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has. This is it,&rdquo; said she, taking from its peg a
very keen and beautiful <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href=
"#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>blade, and handing it to him;
&ldquo;but what&rsquo;s the use in bothering about it? We are dead
already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall see about that,&rdquo; said Keejeepaa.</p>
<p>Just at that moment the wind began to blow, and the dust to fly, as
if a great storm were approaching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hear the great one coming?&rdquo; cried the old
woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; said the gazelle; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a great one
also&mdash;and I have the advantage of being on the inside. Two bulls
can&rsquo;t live in one cattle-pen. Either he will live in this house,
or I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the terror the old lady was in, she had to smile at
the assurance of this little undersized gazelle, and repeated over
again her account of the people with swords and shields who had been
killed by the big snake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, stop your gabbling!&rdquo; said the gazelle; &ldquo;you
can&rsquo;t always judge a banana <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133"
href="#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span>by its color or size. Wait
and see, grandma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a very little while the big snake, Neeoka Mkoo, came into the
courtyard, and went around to all the pots and ate their contents. Then
he came to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, old lady,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;how is it I smell a
new kind of odor inside there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s nothing, good master,&rdquo; replied the old
woman; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been so busy around here lately I
haven&rsquo;t had time to look after myself; but this morning I used
some perfume, and that&rsquo;s what you smell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, Keejeepaa had drawn the sword, and was standing just inside the
doorway; so, when the big snake put his head in, it was cut off so
quickly that its owner did not know it was gone. When he put in his
second head it was cut off with the same quickness; and, feeling a
little irritation, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s inside there,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=
"pb134">134</a>]</span>scratching me?&rdquo; He then thrust in his
third head, and that was cut off also.</p>
<p>This continued until six heads had been disposed of, when Neeoka
Mkoo unfolded his rings and lashed around so that the gazelle and the
old woman could not see one another through the dust.</p>
<p>Then the snake thrust in his seventh head, and the gazelle, crying:
&ldquo;Now your time has come; you&rsquo;ve climbed many trees, but
this you can not climb,&rdquo; severed it, and immediately fell down in
a fainting fit.</p>
<p>Well, that old woman, although she was seventy-five years of age,
jumped, and shouted, and laughed, like a girl of nine. Then she ran and
got water, and sprinkled the gazelle, and turned him this way and that
way, until at last he sneezed; which greatly pleased the old person,
who fanned him and tended him until he was quite recovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my!&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;who would have <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=
"pb135">135</a>]</span>thought you could be a match for him, my
grandson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Keejeepaa; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all
over. Now show me everything around this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she showed him everything, from top to bottom: store-rooms full
of goods, chambers full of expensive foods, rooms containing handsome
people who had been kept prisoners for a long time, slaves, and
everything.</p>
<p>Next he asked her if there was any person who was likely to lay
claim to the place or make any trouble; and she answered: &ldquo;No
one; everything here belongs to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you stay here and
take care of these things until I bring my master. This place belongs
to him now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keejeepaa stayed three days examining the house, and said to
himself: &ldquo;Well, when my master comes here he will be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span>much
pleased with what I have done for him, and he&rsquo;ll appreciate it
after the life he&rsquo;s been accustomed to. As to his father-in-law,
there is not a house in his town that can compare with this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the fourth day he departed, and in due time arrived at the town
where the sultan and his master lived. Then there were great
rejoicings; the sultan being particularly pleased at his return, while
his master felt as if he had received a new lease of life.</p>
<p>After everything had settled down a little, Keejeepaa told his
master he must be ready to go, with his wife, to his new home after
four days. Then he went and told the sultan that Sultan Daaraaee
desired to take his wife to his own town in four days; to which the
sultan strongly objected; but the gazelle said it was his
master&rsquo;s wish, and at last everything was arranged.</p>
<p>On the day of the departure a great <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb137" href="#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span>company assembled to
escort Sultan Daaraaee and his bride. There were the bride&rsquo;s
ladies-in-waiting, and slaves, and horsemen, and Keejeepaa leading them
all.</p>
<p>So they traveled three days, resting when the sun was overhead, and
stopping each evening about five o&rsquo;clock to eat and sleep;
arising next morning at day-break, eating, and going forward again. And
all this time the gazelle took very little rest, going all through the
company, from the ladies to the slaves, and seeing that every one was
well supplied with food and quite comfortable; therefore the entire
company loved him and valued him like the apples of their eyes.</p>
<p>On the fourth day, during the afternoon, many houses came into view,
and some of the folks called Keejeepaa&rsquo;s attention to them.
&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;that is our town, and that
house you see yonder is the palace of Sultan Daaraaee.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span></p>
<p>So they went on, and all the company filed into the courtyard, while
the gazelle and his master went into the house.</p>
<p>When the old woman saw Keejeepaa, she began to dance, and shout, and
carry on, just as she did when he killed Neeoka Mkoo, and taking up his
foot she kissed it; but Keejeepaa said: &ldquo;Old lady, let me alone;
the one to be made much of is this my master, Sultan Daaraaee. Kiss his
feet; he has the first honors whenever he is present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman excused herself for not knowing the master, and then
Sultan Daaraaee and the gazelle went around on a tour of inspection.
The sultan ordered all the prisoners to be released, the horses to be
sent out to pasture, all the rooms to be swept, the furniture to be
dusted, and, in the meantime, servants were busy preparing food. Then
every one had apartments assigned to him, and all were satisfied.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span></p>
<p>After they had remained there some time, the ladies who had
accompanied the bride expressed a desire to return to their own homes.
Keejeepaa begged them not to hurry away, but after a while they
departed, each loaded with gifts by the gazelle, for whom they had a
thousand times more affection than for his master. Then things settled
down to their regular routine.</p>
<p>One day the gazelle said to the old woman: &ldquo;I think the
conduct of my master is very singular. I have done nothing but good for
him all the time I have been with him. I came to this town and braved
many dangers for him, and when all was over I gave everything to him.
Yet he has never asked: &lsquo;How did you get this house? How did you
get this town? Who is the owner of this house? Have you rented all
these things, or have they been given you? What has become of the
inhabitants of the place?&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>understand him. And further: although I have
done nothing but good for him, he has never done one good thing for me.
Nothing here is really his. He never saw such a house or town as this
since the day he was born, and he doesn&rsquo;t own anything of it. I
believe the old folks were right when they said, &lsquo;If you want to
do any person good, don&rsquo;t do too much; do him a little harm
occasionally, and he&rsquo;ll think more of you.&rsquo; However,
I&rsquo;ve done all I can now, and I&rsquo;d like to see him make some
little return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next morning the old woman was awakened early by the gazelle
calling, &ldquo;Mother! Mother!&rdquo; When she went to him she found
he was sick in his stomach, feverish, and all his legs ached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and tell my master I am very
ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she went upstairs and found the master and mistress sitting on a
marble couch, covered with a striped silk scarf from India.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the master, &ldquo;what do you want, old
woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my master,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;Keejeepaa is
sick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mistress started and said: &ldquo;Dear me! What is the matter
with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All his body pains him. He is sick all over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said the master, &ldquo;what can I do? Go
and get some of that red millet, that is too common for our use, and
make him some gruel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious!&rdquo; exclaimed his wife, staring at him in
amazement; &ldquo;do you wish her to feed our friend with stuff that a
horse would not eat if he were ever so hungry? This is not right of
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, get out!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re crazy. We
eat rice; isn&rsquo;t red millet good enough for a gazelle that cost
only a dime?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but he is no ordinary gazelle. He should be as dear to
you as the apple of your eye. If sand got in your eye it would trouble
you.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk too much,&rdquo; returned her husband; then, turning
to the old woman, he said, &ldquo;Go and do as I told you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the old woman went downstairs, and when she saw the gazelle, she
began to cry, and say, &ldquo;Oh, dear! oh, dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a long while before the gazelle could persuade her to tell
him what had passed upstairs, but at last she told him all. When he had
heard it, he said: &ldquo;Did he really tell you to make me red millet
gruel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;do you think I would say such a
thing if it were not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Keejeepaa, &ldquo;I believe what the old
folks said was right. However, we&rsquo;ll give him another chance. Go
up to him again, and tell him I am very sick, and that I can&rsquo;t
eat that gruel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she went upstairs, and found the master and mistress sitting by
the window, drinking coffee.</p>
<p>The master, looking around and seeing <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb143" href="#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>her, said:
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now, old woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she said: &ldquo;Master, I am sent by Keejeepaa. He is very sick
indeed, and has not taken the gruel you told me to make for
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bother!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Hold your tongue, and
keep your feet still, and shut your eyes, and stop your ears with wax;
then, if that gazelle tells you to come up here, say that your legs are
stiff; and if he tells you to listen, say your ears are deaf; and if he
tells you to look, say your sight has failed you; and if he wants you
to talk, tell him your tongue is paralyzed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the old woman heard these words, she stood and stared, and was
unable to move. As for his wife, her face became sad, and the tears
began to start from her eyes; observing which, her husband said,
sharply, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you, sultan&rsquo;s
daughter?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144"
name="pb144">144</a>]</span></p>
<p>The lady replied, &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s madness is his
undoing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say that, mistress?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I am grieved, my husband, at your
treatment of Keejeepaa. Whenever I say a good word for the gazelle you
dislike to hear it. I pity you that your understanding is
gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by talking in that manner to me?&rdquo; he
blustered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, advice is a blessing, if properly taken. A husband
should advise with his wife, and a wife with her husband; then they are
both blessed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, stop,&rdquo; said her husband, impatiently;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s evident you&rsquo;ve lost your senses. You should be
chained up.&rdquo; Then he said to the old woman: &ldquo;Never mind her
talk; and as to this gazelle, tell him to stop bothering me and putting
on style, as if he were the sultan. I can&rsquo;t eat, I can&rsquo;t
drink, I can&rsquo;t sleep, because <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb145" href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>of that gazelle
worrying me with his messages. First, the gazelle is sick; then, the
gazelle doesn&rsquo;t like what he gets to eat. Confound it! If he
likes to eat, let him eat; if he doesn&rsquo;t like to eat, let him die
and be out of the way. My mother is dead, and my father is dead, and I
still live and eat; shall I be put out of my way by a gazelle, that I
bought for a dime, telling me he wants this thing or that thing? Go and
tell him to learn how to behave himself toward his
superiors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the old woman went downstairs, she found the gazelle was
bleeding at the mouth, and in a very bad way. All she could say was,
&ldquo;My son, the good you did is all lost; but be patient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the gazelle wept with the old woman when she told him all that
had passed, and he said, &ldquo;Mother, I am dying, not only from
sickness, but from shame and anger at this man&rsquo;s
ingratitude.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146"
name="pb146">146</a>]</span></p>
<p>After a while Keejeepaa told the old woman to go and tell the master
that he believed he was dying. When she went upstairs she found
Daaraaee chewing sugar-cane, and she said to him, &ldquo;Master, the
gazelle is worse; we think him nearer to dying than getting
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which he answered: &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I told you often enough
not to bother me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then his wife said: &ldquo;Oh, husband, won&rsquo;t you go down and
see the poor gazelle? If you don&rsquo;t like to go, let me go and see
him. He never gets a single good thing from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he turned to the old woman and said, &ldquo;Go and tell that
nuisance of a gazelle to die eleven times if he chooses to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, husband,&rdquo; persisted the lady, &ldquo;what has
Keejeepaa done to you? Has he done you any wrong? Such words as yours
people use to their enemies only. Surely the gazelle is not your enemy.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>All the people who know him, great and lowly,
love him dearly, and they will think it very wrong of you if you
neglect him. Now, do be kind to him, Sultan Daaraaee.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figure xd20e1759width" id="p147"><img src="images/p147.jpg"
alt="The gazelle wept with the old woman." width="405" height="518">
<p class="figureHead">The gazelle wept with the old woman.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span></p>
<p>But he only repeated his assertion that she had lost her wits, and
would have nothing further of argument.</p>
<p>So the old woman went down and found the gazelle worse than
ever.</p>
<p>In the meantime Sultan Daaraaee&rsquo;s wife managed to give some
rice to a servant to cook for the gazelle, and also sent him a soft
shawl to cover him and a pillow to lie upon. She also sent him a
message that if he wished, she would have her father&rsquo;s best
physicians attend him.</p>
<p>All this was too late, however, for just as these good things
arrived, Keejeepaa died.</p>
<p>When the people heard he was dead, they went running around crying
and having an awful time; and when Sultan Daaraaee found out what all
the commotion was about he was very indignant, remarking, &ldquo;Why,
you are making as much fuss as if <i>I</i> were dead, and all over a
gazelle that I bought for a dime!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb149" href="#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span></p>
<p>But his wife said: &ldquo;Husband, it was this gazelle that came to
ask me of my father, it was he who brought me from my father&rsquo;s,
and it was to him I was given by my father. He gave you everything
good, and you do not possess a thing that he did not procure for you.
He did everything he could to help you, and you not only returned him
unkindness, but now he is dead you have ordered people to throw him
into the well. Let us alone, that we may weep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the gazelle was taken and thrown into the well.</p>
<p>Then the lady wrote a letter telling her father to come to her
directly, and despatched it by trusty messengers; upon the receipt of
which the sultan and his attendants started hurriedly to visit his
daughter.</p>
<p>When they arrived, and heard that the gazelle was dead and had been
thrown into the well, they wept very much; and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span>the
sultan, and the vizir, and the judges, and the rich chief men, all went
down into the well and brought up the body of Keejeepaa, and took it
away with them and buried it.</p>
<p>Now, that night the lady dreamt that she was at home at her
father&rsquo;s house; and when dawn came she awoke and found she was in
her own bed in her own town again.</p>
<p>And her husband dreamed that he was on the dust heap, scratching;
and when he awoke there he was, with both hands full of dust, looking
for grains of millet. Staring wildly he looked around to the right and
left, saying: &ldquo;Oh, who has played this trick on me? How did I get
back here, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the children going along, and seeing him, laughed and
hooted at him, calling out: &ldquo;Hullo, Haamdaanee, where have you
been? Where do you come from? We thought you were dead long ago.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span></p>
<p>So the sultan&rsquo;s daughter lived in happiness with her people
until the end, and that beggar-man continued to scratch for grains of
millet in the dust heap until he died.</p>
<p>If this story is good, the goodness belongs to all; if it is bad,
the badness belongs only to him who told it.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Sultan Maaj&prime;noon had seven sons and a big cat,
of all of whom he was very proud.</p>
<p>Everything went well until one day the cat went and caught a calf.
When they told the sultan he said, &ldquo;Well, the cat is mine, and
the calf is mine.&rdquo; So they said, &ldquo;Oh, all right,
master,&rdquo; and let the matter drop.</p>
<p>A few days later the cat caught a goat; and when they told the
sultan he said, &ldquo;The cat is mine, and the goat is mine;&rdquo;
and so that settled it again.</p>
<p>Two days more passed, and the cat caught a cow. They told the
sultan, and he shut them up with &ldquo;My cat, and my cow.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span></p>
<p>After another two days the cat caught a donkey; same result.</p>
<p>Next it caught a horse; same result.</p>
<p>The next victim was a camel; and when they told the sultan he said:
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you folks? It was my cat, and my
camel. I believe you don&rsquo;t like my cat, and want it killed,
bringing me tales about it every day. Let it eat whatever it wants
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a very short time it caught a child, and then a full-grown man;
but each time the sultan remarked that both the cat and its victim were
his, and thought no more of it.</p>
<p>Meantime the cat grew bolder, and hung around a low, open place near
the town, pouncing on people going for water, or animals out at
pasture, and eating them.</p>
<p>At last some of the people plucked up courage; and, going to the
sultan, said: &ldquo;How is this, master? As you are our <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>sultan you are our protector,&mdash;or ought to
be,&mdash;yet you have allowed this cat to do as it pleases, and now it
lives just out of town there, and kills everything living that goes
that way, while at night it comes into town and does the same thing.
Now, what on earth are we to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Maajnoon only replied: &ldquo;I really believe you hate my cat.
I suppose you want me to kill it; but I shall do no such thing.
Everything it eats is mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course the folks were astonished at this result of the interview,
and, as no one dared to kill the cat, they all had to remove from the
vicinity where it lived. But this did not mend matters, because, when
it found no one came that way, it shifted its quarters likewise.</p>
<p>So complaints continued to pour in, until at last Sultan Maajnoon
gave orders that if any one came to make accusations against the cat,
he was to be informed that the master could not be seen. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span></p>
<p>When things got so that people neither let their animals out nor
went out themselves, the cat went farther into the country, killing and
eating cattle, and fowls, and everything that came its way.</p>
<p>One day the sultan said to six of his sons, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
to look at the country to-day; come along with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The seventh son was considered too young to go around anywhere, and
was always left at home with the women folk, being called by his
brothers Mkaa&prime;ah Jeecho&prime;nee, which means Mr.
Sit-in-the-kitchen.</p>
<p>Well, they went, and presently came to a thicket. The father was in
front and the six sons following him, when the cat jumped out and
killed three of the latter.</p>
<p>The attendants shouted, &ldquo;The cat! the cat!&rdquo; and the
soldiers asked permission to search for and kill it, which the sultan
readily granted, saying: &ldquo;This is not a cat, it is a
noon&prime;dah. It has taken from me my own sons.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span></p>
<p>Now, nobody had ever seen a noondah, but they all knew it was a
terrible beast that could kill and eat all other living things.</p>
<p>When the sultan began to bemoan the loss of his sons, some of those
who heard him said: &ldquo;Ah, master, this noondah does not select his
prey. He doesn&rsquo;t say: &lsquo;This is my master&rsquo;s son,
I&rsquo;ll leave him alone,&rsquo; or, &lsquo;This is my master&rsquo;s
wife, I won&rsquo;t eat her.&rsquo; When we told you what the cat had
done, you always said it was your cat, and what it ate was yours, and
now it has killed your sons, and we don&rsquo;t believe it would
hesitate to eat even you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he said, &ldquo;I fear you are right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for the soldiers who tried to get the cat, some were killed and
the remainder ran away, and the sultan and his living sons took the
dead bodies home and buried them.</p>
<p>Now when Mkaaah Jeechonee, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160"
href="#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span>seventh son, heard that his
brothers had been killed by the noondah, he said to his mother,
&ldquo;I, too, will go, that it may kill me as well as my brothers, or
I will kill it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But his mother said: &ldquo;My son, I do not like to have you go.
Those three are already dead; and if you are killed also, will not that
be one wound upon another to my heart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I can not help going;
but do not tell my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So his mother made him some cakes, and sent some attendants with
him; and he took a great spear, as sharp as a razor, and a sword, bade
her farewell, and departed.</p>
<p>As he had always been left at home, he had no very clear idea what
he was going to hunt for; so he had not gone far beyond the suburbs,
when, seeing a very large dog, he concluded that this was the animal he
was after; so he killed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href=
"#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>it, tied a rope to it, and dragged
it home, singing,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Oh, mother, I have killed</p>
<p class="line">The noondah, eater of the people.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">When his mother, who was upstairs, heard him, she
looked out of the window, and, seeing what he had brought, said,
&ldquo;My son, this is not the noondah, eater of the people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he left the carcass outside and went in to talk about it, and his
mother said, &ldquo;My dear boy, the noondah is a much larger animal
than that; but if I were you, I&rsquo;d give the business up and stay
at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;no staying at home
for me until I have met and fought the noondah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he set out again, and went a great deal farther than he had gone
on the former day. Presently he saw a civet cat, and, believing it to
be the animal he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162"
name="pb162">162</a>]</span>was in search of, he killed it, bound it,
and dragged it home, singing,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Oh, mother, I have killed</p>
<p class="line">The noondah, eater of the people.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">When his mother saw the civet cat, she said, &ldquo;My
son, this is not the noondah, eater of the people.&rdquo; And he threw
it away.</p>
<p>Again his mother entreated him to stay at home, but he would not
listen to her, and started off again.</p>
<p>This time he went away off into the forest, and seeing a bigger cat
than the last one, he killed it, bound it, and dragged it home,
singing,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Oh, mother, I have killed</p>
<p class="line">The noondah, eater of the people.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But directly his mother saw it, she had to tell him,
as before, &ldquo;My son, this is not the noondah, eater of the
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was, of course, very much troubled at this; and his mother said,
&ldquo;Now, where <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163"
name="pb163">163</a>]</span>do you expect to find this noondah? You
don&rsquo;t know where it is, and you don&rsquo;t know what it looks
like. You&rsquo;ll get sick over this; you&rsquo;re not looking so well
now as you did. Come, stay at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he said: &ldquo;There are three things, one of which I shall do:
I shall die; I shall find the noondah and kill it; or I shall return
home unsuccessful. In any case, I&rsquo;m off again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time he went farther than before, saw a zebra, killed it, bound
it, and dragged it home, singing,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Oh, mother, I have killed</p>
<p class="line">The noondah, eater of the people.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Of course his mother had to tell him, once again,
&ldquo;My son, this is not the noondah, eater of the people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a good deal of argument, in which his mother&rsquo;s
persuasion, as usual, was of no avail, he went off again, going farther
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>than ever, when he caught a giraffe; and when he
had killed it he said: &ldquo;Well, this time I&rsquo;ve been
successful. This must be the noondah.&rdquo; So he dragged it home,
singing,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Oh, mother, I have killed</p>
<p class="line">The noondah, eater of the people.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Again his mother had to assure him, &ldquo;My son,
this is not the noondah, eater of the people.&rdquo; She then pointed
out to him that his brothers were not running about hunting for the
noondah, but staying at home attending to their own business. But,
remarking that all brothers were not alike, he expressed his
determination to stick to his task until it came to a successful
termination, and went off again, a still greater distance than
before.</p>
<p>While going through the wilderness he espied a rhinoceros asleep
under a tree, and turning to his attendants he exclaimed, &ldquo;At
last I see the noondah.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165"
href="#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Where, master?&rdquo; they all cried, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, under the tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-h! What shall we do?&rdquo; they asked.</p>
<p>And he answered: &ldquo;First of all, let us eat our fill, then we
will attack it. We have found it in a good place, though if it kills
us, we can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they all took out their arrowroot cakes and ate till they were
satisfied.</p>
<p>Then Mkaaah Jeechonee said, &ldquo;Each of you take two guns; lay
one beside you and take the other in your hands, and at the proper time
let us all fire at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they said, &ldquo;All right, master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they crept cautiously through the bushes and got around to the
other side of the tree, at the back of the rhinoceros; then they closed
up till they were quite near it, and all fired together. The beast
jumped up, ran a little way, and then fell down dead. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span></p>
<p>They bound it, and dragged it for two whole days, until they reached
the town, when Mkaaah Jeechonee began singing,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Oh, mother, I have killed</p>
<p class="line">The noondah, eater of the people.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But he received the same answer from his mother:
&ldquo;My son, this is not the noondah, eater of the people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And many persons came and looked at the rhinoceros, and felt very
sorry for the young man. As for his father and mother, they both begged
of him to give up, his father offering to give him anything he
possessed if he would only stay at home. But he said, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t hear what you are saying; good-bye,&rdquo; and was off
again.</p>
<p>This time he still further increased the distance from his home, and
at last he saw an elephant asleep at noon in the forest. Thereupon he
said to his attendants, &ldquo;Now we <i>have</i> found the
noondah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, where is he?&rdquo; said they. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name="pb167">167</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yonder, in the shade. Do you see it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figure xd20e1979width" id="p167"><img src="images/p167.jpg"
alt="They crept cautiously through the bushes." width="440" height=
"585">
<p class="figureHead">They crept cautiously through the bushes.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, master; shall we march up to it?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name="pb168">168</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;If we march up to it, and it is looking this way, it will
come at us, and if it does that, some of us will be killed. I think we
had best let one man steal up close and see which way its face is
turned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As every one thought this was a good idea, a slave named
Keerobo&prime;to crept on his hands and knees, and had a good look at
it. When he returned in the same manner, his master asked: &ldquo;Well,
what&rsquo;s the news? Is it the noondah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; replied Keeroboto; &ldquo;but I think
there is very little doubt that it is. It is broad, with a very big
head, and, goodness, I never saw such large ears!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Mkaaah Jeechonee; &ldquo;let us eat,
and then go for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they took their arrowroot cakes, and their molasses cakes, and
ate until they were quite full.</p>
<p>Then the youth said to them: &ldquo;My people, to-day is perhaps the
last we shall <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>ever see; so we will take leave of each other.
Those who are to escape will escape, and those who are to die will die;
but if I die, let those who escape tell my mother and father not to
grieve for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But his attendants said, &ldquo;Oh, come along, master; none of us
will die, please God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they went on their hands and knees till they were close up, and
then they said to Mkaaah Jeechonee, &ldquo;Give us your plan,
master;&rdquo; but he said, &ldquo;There is no plan, only let all fire
at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, they fired all at once, and immediately the elephant jumped up
and charged at them. Then such a helter-skelter flight as there was!
They threw away their guns and everything they carried, and made for
the trees, which they climbed with surprising alacrity.</p>
<p>As to the elephant, he kept straight ahead until he fell down some
distance away. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span></p>
<p>They all remained in the trees from three until six o&rsquo;clock in
the morning, without food and without clothing.</p>
<p>The young man sat in his tree and wept bitterly, saying, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t exactly know what death is, but it seems to me this must be
very like it.&rdquo; As no one could see any one else, he did not know
where his attendants were, and though he wished to come down from the
tree, he thought, &ldquo;Maybe the noondah is down below there, and
will eat me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each attendant was in exactly the same fix, wishing to come down,
but afraid the noondah was waiting to eat him.</p>
<p>Keeroboto had seen the elephant fall, but was afraid to get down by
himself, saying, &ldquo;Perhaps, though it has fallen down, it is not
dead.&rdquo; But presently he saw a dog go up to it and smell it, and
then he was sure it was dead. Then he got down from the tree as fast as
he could <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span>and gave a signal cry, which was answered; but
not being sure from whence the answer came, he repeated the cry,
listening intently. When it was answered he went straight to the place
from which the sound proceeded, and found two of his companions in one
tree. To them he said, &ldquo;Come on; get down; the noondah is
dead.&rdquo; So they got down quickly and hunted around until they
found their master. When they told him the news, he came down also; and
after a little the attendants had all gathered together and had picked
up their guns and their clothes, and were all right again. But they
were all weak and hungry, so they rested and ate some food, after which
they went to examine their prize.</p>
<p>As soon as Mkaaah Jeechonee saw it he said, &ldquo;Ah, this
<i>is</i> the noondah! This is it! This is it!&rdquo; And they all
agreed that it was <i>it</i>.</p>
<p>So they dragged the elephant three days <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>to
their town, and then the youth began singing,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Oh, mother, this is he,</p>
<p class="line">The noondah, eater of the people.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">He was, naturally, quite upset when his mother
replied, &ldquo;My son, this is not the noondah, eater of the
people.&rdquo; She further said: &ldquo;Poor boy! what trouble you have
been through. All the people are astonished that one so young should
have such a great understanding!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then his father and mother began their entreaties again, and finally
it was agreed that this next trip should be his last, whatever the
result might be.</p>
<p>Well, they started off again, and went on and on, past the forest,
until they came to a very high mountain, at the foot of which they
camped for the night.</p>
<div class="figure xd20e2045width" id="p173"><img src="images/p173.jpg"
alt="They camped for the night." width="302" height="639">
<p class="figureHead">They camped for the night.</p>
</div>
<p>In the morning they cooked their rice and ate it, and then Mkaaah
Jeechonee said: &ldquo;Let us now climb the mountain, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name="pb175">175</a>]</span>and
look all over the country from its peak.&rdquo; And they went and they
went, until after a long, weary while, they reached the top, where they
sat down to rest and form their plans.</p>
<p>Now, one of the attendants, named Shindaa&prime;no, while walking
about, cast his eyes down the side of the mountain, and suddenly saw a
great beast about half way down; but he could not make out its
appearance distinctly, on account of the distance and the trees.
Calling his master, he pointed it out to him, and something in Mkaaah
Jeechonee&rsquo;s heart told him that it was the noondah. To make sure,
however, he took his gun and his spear and went partly down the
mountain to get a better view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this must be the noondah. My
mother told me its ears were small, and those are small; she told me
the noondah is broad and short, and so is this; she said it has two
blotches, like <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=
"pb176">176</a>]</span>a civet cat, and there are the blotches; she
told me the tail is thick, and there is a thick tail. It must be the
noondah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he went back to his attendants and bade them eat heartily,
which they did. Next he told them to leave every unnecessary thing
behind, because if they had to run they would be better without
encumbrance, and if they were victorious they could return for their
goods.</p>
<p>When they had made all their arrangements they started down the
mountain, but when they had got about half way down Keeroboto and
Shindaano were afraid. Then the youth said to them: &ldquo;Oh,
let&rsquo;s go on; don&rsquo;t be afraid. We all have to live and die.
What are you frightened about?&rdquo; So, thus encouraged, they went
on.</p>
<p>When they came near the place, Mkaaah Jeechonee ordered them to take
off all their clothing except one piece, and to place that tightly on
their bodies, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span>so that if they had to run they would not be
caught by thorns or branches.</p>
<p>So when they came close to the beast, they saw that it was asleep,
and all agreed that it was the noondah.</p>
<p>Then the young man said, &ldquo;Now the sun is setting, shall we
fire at it, or let be till morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they all wished to fire at once, and see what the result would
be without further tax on their nerves; therefore they arranged that
they should all fire together.</p>
<p>They all crept up close, and when the master gave the word, they
discharged their guns together. The noondah did not move; that one dose
had been sufficient. Nevertheless, they all turned and scampered up to
the top of the mountain. There they ate and rested for the night.</p>
<p>In the morning they ate their rice, and then went down to see how
matters <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>were, when they found the beast lying dead.</p>
<p>After resting and eating, they started homeward, dragging the dead
beast with them. On the fourth day it began to give indications of
decay, and the attendants wished to abandon it; but Mkaaah Jeechonee
said they would continue to drag it if there was only one bone
left.</p>
<p>When they came near the town he began to sing,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Mother, mother, I have come</p>
<p class="line">From the evil spirits, home.</p>
<p class="line">Mother, listen while I sing;</p>
<p class="line">While I tell you what I bring.</p>
<p class="line">Oh, mother, I have killed</p>
<p class="line">The noondah, eater of the people.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">And when his mother looked out, she cried, &ldquo;My
son, this <i>is</i> the noondah, eater of the people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then all the people came out to welcome him, and his father was
overcome <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>with joy, and loaded him with honors, and
procured him a rich and beautiful wife; and when he died Mkaaah
Jeechonee became sultan, and lived long and happily, beloved by all the
people. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was once a sultan who had three little sons, and
no one seemed to be able to teach them anything; which greatly grieved
both the sultan and his wife.</p>
<p>One day a magician came to the sultan and said, &ldquo;If I take
your three boys and teach them to read and write, and make great
scholars of them, what will you give me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the sultan said, &ldquo;I will give you half of my
property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the magician; &ldquo;that won&rsquo;t
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you half of the towns I own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; that will not satisfy me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want, then?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb184" href="#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;When I have made them scholars and bring them back to you,
choose two of them for yourself and give me the third; for I want to
have a companion of my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; said the sultan.</p>
<p>So the magician took them away, and in a remarkably short time
taught them to read, and to make letters, and made them quite good
scholars. Then he took them back to the sultan and said: &ldquo;Here
are the children. They are all equally good scholars.
Choose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the sultan took the two he preferred, and the magician went away
with the third, whose name was Keejaa&prime;naa, to his own house,
which was a very large one.</p>
<p>When they arrived, Mchaa&prime;wee, the magician, gave the youth all
the keys, saying, &ldquo;Open whatever you wish to.&rdquo; Then he told
him that he was his father, and that he was going away for a month.</p>
<div class="figure xd20e2141width" id="p185"><img src="images/p185.jpg"
alt="The magician gave the youth all the keys." width="427" height=
"624">
<p class="figureHead">The magician gave the youth all the keys.</p>
</div>
<p>When he was gone, Keejaanaa took the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb187" href="#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span>keys and went to
examine the house. He opened one door, and saw a room full of liquid
gold. He put his finger in, and the gold stuck to it, and, wipe and rub
as he would, the gold would not come off; so he wrapped a piece of rag
around it, and when his supposed father came home and saw the rag, and
asked him what he had been doing to his finger, he was afraid to tell
him the truth, so he said that he had cut it.</p>
<p>Not very long after, Mchaawee went away again, and the youth took
the keys and continued his investigations.</p>
<p>The first room he opened was filled with the bones of goats, the
next with sheep&rsquo;s bones, the next with the bones of oxen, the
fourth with the bones of donkeys, the fifth with those of horses, the
sixth contained men&rsquo;s skulls, and in the seventh was a live
horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; said the horse; &ldquo;where do you come from,
you son of Adam?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href=
"#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my father&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; said Keejaanaa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed!&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve
got a pretty nice parent! Do you know that he occupies himself with
eating people, and donkeys, and horses, and oxen and goats and
everything he can lay his hands on? You and I are the only living
things left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This scared the youth pretty badly, and he faltered, &ldquo;What are
we to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; said the horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keejaanaa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m Faaraa&prime;see. Now, Keejaanaa, first of
all, come and unfasten me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth did so at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, open the door of the room with the gold in it, and
I will swallow it all; then I&rsquo;ll go and wait for you under the
big tree down the road a little way. When the magician comes home, he
will say to you, &lsquo;Let us go for firewood;&rsquo; then you answer,
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand that work;&rsquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span>and
he will go by himself. When he comes back, he will put a great big pot
on the hook and will tell you to make a fire under it. Tell him you
don&rsquo;t know how to make a fire, and he will make it himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he will bring a large quantity of butter, and while it
is getting hot he will put up a swing and say to you, &lsquo;Get up
there, and I&rsquo;ll swing you.&rsquo; But you tell him you never
played at that game, and ask him to swing first, that you may see how
it is done. Then he will get up to show you; and you must push him into
the big pot, and then come to me as quickly as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the horse went away.</p>
<p>Now, Mchaawee had invited some of his friends to a feast at his
house that evening; so, returning home early, he said to Keejaanaa,
&ldquo;Let us go for firewood;&rdquo; but the youth answered, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t understand that work.&rdquo; So he went by himself and
brought the wood. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190"
name="pb190">190</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then he hung up the big pot and said, &ldquo;Light the fire;&rdquo;
but the youth said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to do it.&rdquo; So
the magician laid the wood under the pot and lighted it himself.</p>
<p>Then he said, &ldquo;Put all that butter in the pot;&rdquo; but the
youth answered, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t lift it; I&rsquo;m not strong
enough.&rdquo; So he put in the butter himself.</p>
<p>Next Mchaawee said, &ldquo;Have you seen our country game?&rdquo;
And Keejaanaa answered, &ldquo;I think not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the magician, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s play at it
while the butter is getting hot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he tied up the swing and said to Keejaanaa, &ldquo;Get up here,
and learn the game.&rdquo; But the youth said: &ldquo;You get up first
and show me. I&rsquo;ll learn quicker that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The magician got into the swing, and just as he got started
Keejaanaa gave him a push right into the big pot; and as the butter was
by this time boiling, it not only killed him, but cooked him also.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name=
"pb191">191</a>]</span></p>
<p>As soon as the youth had pushed the magician into the big pot, he
ran as fast as he could to the big tree, where the horse was waiting
for him.</p>
<div class="figure xd20e2199width" id="p191"><img src="images/p191.jpg"
alt="Right into the big pot!" width="446" height="449">
<p class="figureHead">Right into the big pot!</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said Faaraasee; &ldquo;jump on my back and
let&rsquo;s be going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he mounted and they started off. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb192" href="#pb192" name="pb192">192</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the magician&rsquo;s guests arrived they looked everywhere for
him, but, of course, could not find him. Then, after waiting a while,
they began to be very hungry; so, looking around for something to eat,
they saw that the stew in the big pot was done, and, saying to each
other, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s begin, anyway,&rdquo; they started in and ate
the entire contents of the pot. After they had finished, they searched
for Mchaawee again, and finding lots of provisions in the house, they
thought they would stay there until he came; but after they had waited
a couple of days and eaten all the food in the place, they gave him up
and returned to their homes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Keejaanaa and the horse continued on their way until they
had gone a great distance, and at last they stopped near a large
town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us stay here,&rdquo; said the youth, &ldquo;and build a
house.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span></p>
<p>As Faaraasee was agreeable, they did so. The horse coughed up all
the gold he had swallowed, with which they purchased slaves, and
cattle, and everything they needed.</p>
<p>When the people of the town saw the beautiful new house and all the
slaves, and cattle, and riches it contained, they went and told their
sultan, who at once made up his mind that the owner of such a place
must be of sufficient importance to be visited and taken notice of, as
an acquisition to the neighborhood.</p>
<p>So he called on Keejaanaa, and inquired who he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m just an ordinary being, like other
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a traveler?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I have been; but I like this place, and think
I&rsquo;ll settle down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come and walk in our town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to very much, but I need some one to show me
around.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll show you around,&rdquo; said the sultan,
eagerly, for he was quite taken with the young man.</p>
<p>After this Keejaanaa and the sultan became great friends; and in the
course of time the young man married the sultan&rsquo;s daughter, and
they had one son.</p>
<p>They lived very happily together, and Keejaanaa loved Faaraasee as
his own soul. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=

<p class="first">Once there was a very learned physician, who died
leaving his wife with a little baby boy, whom, when he was old enough,
she named, according to his father&rsquo;s wish, Hassee&prime;boo
Kareem&prime; Ed Deen&prime;.</p>
<p>When the boy had been to school, and had learned to read, his mother
sent him to a tailor, to learn his trade, but he could not learn it.
Then he was sent to a silversmith, but he could not learn his trade
either. After that he tried many trades, but could learn none of them.
At last his mother said, &ldquo;Well, stay at home for a while;&rdquo;
and that seemed to suit him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href=
"#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span></p>
<p>One day he asked his mother what his father&rsquo;s business had
been, and she told him he was a very great physician.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are his books?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a long time since I saw them,&rdquo; replied
his mother, &ldquo;but I think they are behind there. Look and
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he hunted around a little and at last found them, but they were
almost ruined by insects, and he gained little from them.</p>
<p>At last, four of the neighbors came to his mother and said,
&ldquo;Let your boy go along with us and cut wood in the forest.&rdquo;
It was their business to cut wood, load it on donkeys, and sell it in
the town for making fires.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;to-morrow I&rsquo;ll buy
him a donkey, and he can start fair with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the next day Hasseeboo, with his donkey, went off with those four
persons, and they worked very hard and made a lot of money that day.
This continued <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span>for six days, but on the seventh day it rained
heavily, and they had to get under the rocks to keep dry.</p>
<p>Now, Hasseeboo sat in a place by himself, and, having nothing else
to do, he picked up a stone and began knocking on the ground with it.
To his surprise the ground gave forth a hollow sound, and he called to
his companions, saying, &ldquo;There seems to be a hole under
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon hearing him knock again, they decided to dig and see what was
the cause of the hollow sound; and they had not gone very deep before
they broke into a large pit, like a well, which was filled to the top
with honey.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t do any firewood chopping after that, but devoted
their entire attention to the collection and sale of the honey.</p>
<p>With a view to getting it all out as quickly as possible, they told
Hasseeboo to go down into the pit and dip out the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name=
"pb200">200</a>]</span>honey, while they put it in vessels and took it
to town for sale. They worked for three days, making a great deal of
money.</p>
<p>At last there was only a little honey left at the very bottom of the
pit, and they told the boy to scrape that together while they went to
get a rope to haul him out.</p>
<p>But instead of getting the rope, they decided to let him remain in
the pit, and divide the money among themselves. So, when he had
gathered the remainder of the honey together, and called for the rope,
he received no answer; and after he had been alone in the pit for three
days he became convinced that his companions had deserted him.</p>
<p>Then those four persons went to his mother and told her that they
had become separated in the forest, that they had heard a lion roaring,
and that they could find no trace of either her son or his donkey.</p>
<p>His mother, of course, cried very much, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name="pb201">201</a>]</span>and
the four neighbors pocketed her son&rsquo;s share of the money.</p>
<p>To return to Hasseeboo.</p>
<p>He passed the time walking about the pit, wondering what the end
would be, eating scraps of honey, sleeping a little, and sitting down
to think.</p>
<p>While engaged in the last occupation, on the fourth day, he saw a
scorpion fall to the ground&mdash;a large one, too&mdash;and he killed
it.</p>
<p>Then suddenly he thought to himself, &ldquo;Where did that scorpion
come from? There must be a hole somewhere. I&rsquo;ll search,
anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he searched around until he saw light through a tiny crack; and
he took his knife and scooped and scooped, until he had made a hole big
enough to pass through; then he went out, and came upon a place he had
never seen before.</p>
<p>Seeing a path, he followed it until he came to a very large house,
the door of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>which was not fastened. So he went inside, and
saw golden doors, with golden locks, and keys of pearl, and beautiful
chairs inlaid with jewels and precious stones, and in a reception room
he saw a couch covered with a splendid spread, upon which he lay
down.</p>
<p>Presently he found himself being lifted off the couch and put in a
chair, and heard some one saying: &ldquo;Do not hurt him; wake him
gently,&rdquo; and on opening his eyes he found himself surrounded by
numbers of snakes, one of them wearing beautiful royal colors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Sulta&prime;nee Waa&prime; <span class="corr" id=
"xd20e2309" title="Source: Neeo&prime;kaa">Neeo&prime;ka</span>, king
of the snakes, and this is my house. Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Hasseeboo Kareem Ed Deen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where I come from, or where I&rsquo;m
going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t bother yourself just now. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name=
"pb203">203</a>]</span>Let&rsquo;s eat; I guess you are hungry, and I
know I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the king gave orders, and some of the other snakes brought the
finest fruits, and they ate and drank and conversed.</p>
<p>When the repast was ended, the king desired to hear
Hasseeboo&rsquo;s story; so he told him all that had happened, and then
asked to hear the story of his host.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the king of the snakes, &ldquo;mine is
rather a long story, but you shall hear it. A long time ago I left this
place, to go and live in the mountains of Al Kaaf&prime;, for the
change of air. One day I saw a stranger coming along, and I said to
him, &lsquo;Where are you from?&rsquo; and he said, &lsquo;I am
wandering in the wilderness.&rsquo; &lsquo;Whose son are you?&rsquo; I
asked. &lsquo;My name is Bolookee&prime;a. My father was a sultan; and
when he died I opened a small chest, inside of which I found a bag,
which contained a small brass box; when I had opened this I
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span>found some writing tied up in a woolen cloth,
and it was all in praise of a prophet. He was described as such a good
and wonderful man, that I longed to see him; but when I made inquiries
concerning him I was told he was not yet born. Then I vowed I would
wander until I should see him. So I left our town, and all my property,
and I am wandering, but I have not yet seen that prophet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I said to him, &lsquo;Where do you expect to find him,
if he&rsquo;s not yet born? Perhaps if you had some serpent&rsquo;s
water you might keep on living until you find him. But it&rsquo;s of no
use talking about that; the serpent&rsquo;s water is too far
away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;good-bye. I must wander
on.&rsquo; So I bade him farewell, and he went his way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, when that man had wandered until he reached Egypt, he
met another man, who asked him, &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am Bolookeea. Who are you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My name is Al Faan&prime;. Where are you
going?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have left my home, and my property, and I am seeking
the prophet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;H&rsquo;m!&rsquo; said Al Faan; &lsquo;I can tell you
of a better occupation than looking for a man that is not born yet. Let
us go and find the king of the snakes and get him to give us a charm
medicine; then we will go to King Solomon and get his rings, and we
shall be able to make slaves of the genii and order them to do whatever
we wish.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Bolookeea said, &lsquo;I have seen the king of the snakes
in the mountain of Al Kaaf.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; said Al Faan; &lsquo;let&rsquo;s
go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Al Faan wanted the ring of Solomon that he might be a
great magician and control the genii and the birds, while all Bolookeea
wanted was to see the great prophet. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb206" href="#pb206" name="pb206">206</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;As they went along, Al Faan said to Bolookeea, &lsquo;Let us
make a cage and entice the king of the snakes into it; then we will
shut the door and carry him off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; said Bolookeea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they made a cage, and put therein a cup of milk and a cup
of wine, and brought it to Al Kaaf; and I, like a fool, went in, drank
up all the wine and became drunk. Then they fastened the door and took
me away with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I came to my senses I found myself in the cage, and
Bolookeea carrying me, and I said, &lsquo;The sons of Adam are no good.
What do you want from me?&rsquo; And they answered, &lsquo;We want some
medicine to put on our feet, so that we may walk upon the water
whenever it is necessary in the course of our journey.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;go along.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We went on until we came to a place where there were a great
number and variety of trees; and when those trees saw <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>me,
they said, &lsquo;I am medicine for this;&rsquo; &lsquo;I am medicine
for that;&rsquo; &lsquo;I am medicine for the head;&rsquo; &lsquo;I am
medicine for the feet;&rsquo; and presently one tree said, &lsquo;If
any one puts my medicine upon his feet he can walk on water.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I told that to those men they said, &lsquo;That is what
we want;&rsquo; and they took a great deal of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they took me back to the mountain and set me free; and
we said good-bye and parted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they left me, they went on their way until they reached
the sea, when they put the medicine on their feet and walked over. Thus
they went many days, until they came near to the place of King Solomon,
where they waited while Al Faan prepared his medicines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they arrived at King Solomon&rsquo;s place, he was
sleeping, and was being watched by genii, and his hand lay on his
chest, with the ring on his finger. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb208" href="#pb208" name="pb208">208</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;As Bolookeea drew near, one of the genii said to him
&lsquo;Where are you going?&rsquo; And he answered, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
here with Al Faan; he&rsquo;s going to take that ring.&rsquo; &lsquo;Go
back,&rsquo; said the genie; &lsquo;keep out of the way. That man is
going to die.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Al Faan had finished his preparations, he said to
Bolookeea, &lsquo;Wait here for me.&rsquo; Then he went forward to take
the ring, when a great cry arose, and he was thrown by some unseen
force a considerable distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Picking himself up, and still believing in the power of his
medicines, he approached the ring again, when a strong breath blew upon
him and he was burnt to ashes in a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While Bolookeea was looking at all this, a voice said,
&lsquo;Go your way; this wretched being is dead.&rsquo; So he returned;
and when he got to the sea again he put the medicine upon his feet and
passed over, and continued to wander for many years. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name="pb209">209</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;One morning he saw a man sitting down, and said
&lsquo;Good-morning,&rsquo; to which the man replied. Then Bolookeea
asked him, &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; and he answered: &lsquo;My name
is Jan Shah. Who are you?&rsquo; So Bolookeea told him who he was, and
asked him to tell him his history. The man, who was weeping and smiling
by turns, insisted upon hearing Bolookeea&rsquo;s story first. After he
had heard it he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, sit down, and I&rsquo;ll tell you my story from
beginning to end. My name is Jan Shah, and my father is
Tooeegha&prime;mus, a great sultan. He used to go every day into the
forest to shoot game; so one day I said to him, &ldquo;Father, let me
go with you into the forest to-day;&rdquo; but he said, &ldquo;Stay at
home. You are better there.&rdquo; Then I cried bitterly, and as I was
his only child, whom he loved dearly, he couldn&rsquo;t stand my tears,
so he said: &ldquo;Very well; you shall go. Don&rsquo;t cry.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name=
"pb210">210</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thus we went to the forest, and took many attendants
with us; and when we reached the place we ate and drank, and then every
one set out to hunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I and my seven slaves went on until we saw a beautiful
gazelle, which we chased as far as the sea without capturing it. When
the gazelle took to the water I and four of my slaves took a boat, the
other three returning to my father, and we chased that gazelle until we
lost sight of the shore, but we caught it and killed it. Just then a
great wind began to blow, and we lost our way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When the other three slaves came to my father, he
asked them, &ldquo;Where is your master?&rdquo; and they told him about
the gazelle and the boat. Then he cried, &ldquo;My son is lost! My son
is lost!&rdquo; and returned to the town and mourned for me as one
dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;After a time we came to an island, where there were a
great many birds. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211"
name="pb211">211</a>]</span>We found fruit and water, we ate and drank,
and at night we climbed into a tree and slept till morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then we rowed to a second island, and, seeing no one
around, we gathered fruit, ate and drank, and climbed a tree as before.
During the night we heard many savage beasts howling and roaring near
us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In the morning we got away as soon as possible, and
came to a third island. Looking around for food, we saw a tree full of
fruit like red-streaked apples; but, as we were about to pick some, we
heard a voice say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch this tree; it belongs to
the king.&rdquo; Toward night a number of monkeys came, who seemed much
pleased to see us, and they brought us all the fruit we could eat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Presently I heard one of them say, &ldquo;Let us make
this man our sultan.&rdquo; Then another one said: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
the use? They&rsquo;ll all run away in the morning.&rdquo; But a third
one said, &ldquo;Not if we <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href=
"#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span>smash their boat.&rdquo; Sure
enough, when we started to leave in the morning, our boat was broken in
pieces. So there was nothing for it but to stay there and be
entertained by the monkeys, who seemed to like us very much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;One day, while strolling about, I came upon a great
stone house, having an inscription on the door, which said, &ldquo;When
any man comes to this island, he will find it difficult to leave,
because the monkeys desire to have a man for their king. If he looks
for a way to escape, he will think there is none; but there is one
outlet, which lies to the north. If you go in that direction you will
come to a great plain, which is infested with lions, leopards, and
snakes. You must fight all of them; and if you overcome them you can go
forward. You will then come to another great plain, inhabited by ants
as big as dogs; their teeth are like those of dogs, and they are very
fierce. You must fight <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href=
"#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span>these also, and if you overcome
them, the rest of the way is clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I consulted with my attendants over this information,
and we came to the conclusion that, as we could only die, anyhow, we
might as well risk death to gain our freedom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As we all had weapons, we set forth; and when we came
to the first plain we fought, and two of my slaves were killed. Then we
went on to the second plain, fought again; my other two slaves were
killed, and I alone escaped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;After that I wandered on for many days, living on
whatever I could find, until at last I came to a town, where I stayed
for some time, looking for employment but finding none.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;One day a man came up to me and said, &ldquo;Are you
looking for work?&rdquo; &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Come with
me, then,&rdquo; said he; and we went to his house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When we got there he produced a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name=
"pb214">214</a>]</span>camel&rsquo;s skin, and said, &ldquo;I shall put
you in this skin, and a great bird will carry you to the top of yonder
mountain. When he gets you there, he will tear this skin off you. You
must then drive him away and push down the precious stones you will
find there. When they are all down, I will get you down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So he put me in the skin; the bird carried me to the
top of the mountain and was about to eat me, when I jumped up, scared
him away, and then pushed down many precious stones. Then I called out
to the man to take me down, but he never answered me, and went
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I gave myself up for a dead man, but went wandering
about, until at last, after passing many days in a great forest, I came
to a house, all by itself; the old man who lived in it gave me food and
drink, and I was revived.</p>
<div class="figure xd20e2430width" id="p215"><img src="images/p215.jpg"
alt="I scared him away." width="434" height="600">
<p class="figureHead">I scared him away.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I remained there a long time, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span>that
old man loved me as if I were his own son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;One day he went away, and giving me the keys, told me
I could open the door of every room except one which he pointed out to
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Of course, when he was gone, this was the first door I
opened. I saw a large garden, through which a stream flowed. Just then
three birds came and alighted by the side of the stream. Immediately
they changed to three most beautiful women. When they had finished
bathing, they put on their clothes, and, as I stood watching them, they
changed into birds again and flew away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I locked the door, and went away; but my appetite was
gone, and I wandered about aimlessly. When the old man came back, he
saw there was something wrong with me, and asked me what was the
matter. Then I told him I had seen those beautiful maidens, that I
loved one of them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218"
name="pb218">218</a>]</span>very much, and that if I could not marry
her I should die.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The old man told me I could not possibly have my wish.
He said the three lovely beings were the daughters of the sultan of the
genii, and that their home was a journey of three years from where we
then were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I told him I couldn&rsquo;t help that. He must get her
for my wife, or I should die. At last he said, &ldquo;Well, wait till
they come again, then hide yourself and steal the clothes of the one
you love so dearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So I waited, and when they came again I stole the
clothes of the youngest, whose name was Sayadaa&prime;tee Shems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When they came out of the water, this one could not
find her clothes. Then I stepped forward and said, &ldquo;I have
them.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she begged, &ldquo;give them to me,
their owner; I want to go away.&rdquo; But I said to her, &ldquo;I love
you very much. I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219"
name="pb219">219</a>]</span>want to marry you.&rdquo; &ldquo;I want to
go to my father,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;You cannot go,&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then her sisters flew away, and I took her into the
house, where the old man married us. He told me not to give her those
clothes I had taken, but to hide them; because if she ever got them she
would fly away to her old home. So I dug a hole in the ground and
buried them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But one day, when I was away from home, she dug them
up and put them on; then, saying to the slave I had given her for an
attendant, &ldquo;When your master returns tell him I have gone home;
if he really loves me he will follow me,&rdquo; she flew away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When I came home they told me this, and I wandered,
searching for her, many years. At last I came to a town where one asked
me, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; and I answered, &ldquo;I am Jan
Shah.&rdquo; &ldquo;What was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href=
"#pb220" name="pb220">220</a>]</span>your father&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Taaeeghamus.&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you the man who married our
mistress?&rdquo; &ldquo;Who is your mistress?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sayadaatee
Shems.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am he!&rdquo; I cried with delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They took me to their mistress, and she brought me to
her father and told him I was her husband; and everybody was happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then we thought we should like to visit our old home,
and her father&rsquo;s genii carried us there in three days. We stayed
there a year and then returned, but in a short time my wife died. Her
father tried to comfort me, and wanted me to marry another of his
daughters, but I refused to be comforted, and have mourned to this day.
That is my story.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Bolookeea went on his way, and wandered till he
died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next Sultaanee Waa Neeoka said to Hasseeboo, &ldquo;Now, when you go
home you will do me injury.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221"
href="#pb221" name="pb221">221</a>]</span></p>
<p>Hasseeboo was very indignant at the idea, and said, &ldquo;I could
not be induced to do you an injury. Pray, send me home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will send you home,&rdquo; said the king; &ldquo;but I am
sure that you will come back and kill me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I dare not be so ungrateful,&rdquo; exclaimed Hasseeboo.
&ldquo;I swear I could not hurt you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the king of the snakes, &ldquo;bear this in
mind: when you go home, do not go to bathe where there are many
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he said, &ldquo;I will remember.&rdquo; So the king sent him
home, and he went to his mother&rsquo;s house, and she was overjoyed to
find that he was not dead.</p>
<p>Now, the sultan of the town was very sick; and it was decided that
the only thing that could cure him would be to kill the king of the
snakes, boil him, and give the soup to the sultan. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name="pb222">222</a>]</span></p>
<p>For a reason known only to himself, the vizir had placed men at the
public baths with this instruction: &ldquo;If any one who comes to
bathe here has a mark on his stomach, seize him and bring him to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Hasseeboo had been home three days he forgot the warning of
Sultaanee Waa Neeoka, and went to bathe with the other people. All of a
sudden he was seized by some soldiers, and brought before the vizir,
who said, &ldquo;Take us to the home of the king of the
snakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where it is,&rdquo; said Hasseeboo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tie him up,&rdquo; commanded the vizir.</p>
<p>So they tied him up and beat him until his back was all raw, and
being unable to stand the pain he cried, &ldquo;Let up! I will show you
the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he led them to the house of the king of the snakes, who, when he
saw <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name=
"pb223">223</a>]</span>him, said, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you you
would come back to kill me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could I help it?&rdquo; cried Hasseeboo. &ldquo;Look at
my back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who has beaten you so dreadfully?&rdquo; asked the king.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vizir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s no hope for me. But you must carry me
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they went along, the king said to Hasseeboo, &ldquo;When we get
to your town I shall be killed and cooked. The first skimming the vizir
will offer to you, but don&rsquo;t you drink it; put it in a bottle and
keep it. The second skimming you must drink, and you will become a
great physician. The third skimming is the medicine that will cure your
sultan. When the vizir asks you if you drank that first skimming say,
&lsquo;I did.&rsquo; Then produce the bottle containing the first, and
say, &lsquo;This is the second, and it is for you.&rsquo; The vizir
will take it, and as soon as he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224"
href="#pb224" name="pb224">224</a>]</span>drinks it he will die, and
both of us will have our revenge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everything happened as the king had said. The vizir died, the sultan
recovered, and Hasseeboo was loved by all as a great physician.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
